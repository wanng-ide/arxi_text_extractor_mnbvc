The twist is parameterized by variable\n$\\eta$. The fact that $z \\sim z + 2 \\pi R$ is periodic makes the twist\ndeformation physical.\n\nMelvin universes has a natural embedding in string theory\n\\cite{Dowker:1993bt,Dowker:1994up,Behrndt:1995si}. Simply embed\n(\\ref{twist}) in 11-dimensional supergravity. Reducing along $z$ gives\nrise to a background in type IIA string theory with a background of\nmagnetic RR 2-form field strength.\n\nAlong similar lines, one can embed (\\ref{twist}) in type IIA\nsupergravity and T-dualize along $z$. This gives rise to a background\nin type IIB string theory\n%\n\\beq ds^2 & = & -dt^2 + d \\vec x^2 + dr^2 + {r^2 d \\varphi^2 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} + {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} d\\tilde z^2 \\cr\nB & = & {\\eta r^2 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} d \\varphi \\wedge d \\tilde z \\cr\ne^{\\phi} & = & \\sqrt{1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} \\cr\n\\tilde z &=& \\tilde z + 2 \\pi \\tilde R, \\qquad \\tilde R  = {\\alpha' \\over R} \\ ,  \\label{melvinbg}\n\\eeq\n%\nwith an axially symmetric magnetic NSNS 3-form field strength in the\nbackground. String theories in backgrounds like (\\ref{melvinbg}) are\nvery special in that the world sheet theory is exactly solvable\n\\cite{Russo:1994cv,Tseytlin:1994ei,Russo:1995tj,Tseytlin:1995fh,Russo:1995aj,Russo:1995ik}. Quantization\nof open strings in Melvin backgrounds have also been studied and was\nshown to be exactly solvable \\cite{Dudas:2001ux,Takayanagi:2001aj} as\nwell.\n\nEmbedding D-branes in Melvin universes can give rise to interesting\nfield theories in the decoupling limit. A D3-brane extended along $t$,\n$\\tilde z$, and two of the $\\vec x$ coordinates gives rise to a\nnon-local field theory known as the ``dipole'' theory\n\\cite{Bergman:2000cw,Bergman:2001rw}. Orienting the D3-brane to be\nextended along the $t$, $r$, $\\varphi$, and $\\tilde z$ coordinates, on\nthe other hand, gives rise to a non-commutative gauge theory with a\nnon-constant non-commutativity parameter\\footnote{The first explicit\nconstruction of models of this type is\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2002nr}.}\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. These\nare field theories, whose Lagrangian \\cite{Hashimoto:2005hy} is\nexpressed most naturally using the deformation quantization formula of\nKontsevich\\footnote{General construction of non-commutative field\ntheory on curved space-time with non-constant non-commutativity\nparameter, arising from D-branes in non-vanishing $H$ field\nbackground, and their relation to the deformation quantization formula\nof Kontsevich, was first discussed in \\cite{Cornalba:2001sm}.}\n\\cite{Kontsevich:1997vb}. Field theories arising as a decoupling\nlimits of various orientations of D-branes in Melvin and related\nclosed string backgrounds along these lines\\footnote{The S-dual NCOS theories with non-constant non-commutativity parameter was studied in  \\cite{Cai:2002sv,Cai:2006tda}.}  were tabulated and\nclassified in Table 1 of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.\\footnote{More\nrecently, a novel non-local field theory, not included in the\nclassification of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}, was discovered\n\\cite{Ganor:2006ub,Ganor:2007qh}.}\n\n\nTo show that the decoupled field theory is a non-commutative field\ntheory, the authors of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb} presented the following\narguments:\n%\n\\begin{itemize}\n%\n\\item The application of Seiberg-Witten formula\\footnote{The normalization of $B$ field is such that $B_{{\\rm Hashimoto-Thomas}}= 2 \\pi \\alpha' B_{{\\rm Seiberg-Witten}}$.} \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}\n%\n\\be (G + {\\theta \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'})^{\\mu \\nu} = [(g + B)_{\\mu \\nu}]^{-1}   \\label{swmap} \\ee\n%\nto the closed string background (\\ref{melvinbg}) gives the following open string metric and the non-commutativity parameter\n%\n\\beq G_{\\mu \\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu &=& -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d \\varphi^2 + d\nz^2 \\cr \\theta^{\\varphi z} & = & 2 \\pi \\alpha' \\eta \\\n \\label{openmetric} \\eeq\n%\nwhich are finite if $\\alpha'$ is scaled to zero keeping $\\Delta = \\alpha' \\eta$ fixed.\n\n\\item Solution of the classical equations of motion of an open string traveling freely on the D3-brane with angular momentum $J$ has a dipole structure whose size is given by\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}\n%\n\\be L = \\theta^{\\varphi z} J \\ . \\ee\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnother suggestive argument is the similarity between $\\alpha'\n\\rightarrow 0$ limit of critical string theory and the boundary\nPoisson sigma-model \\cite{Cattaneo:1999fm} as was pointed out, e.g.,\nin \\cite{Baulieu:2001fi}. As was emphasized in \\cite{Baulieu:2001fi},\nhowever, the two theories are not to be understood as being equivalent\nor continuously connected. This apparent similarity therefore does not\nconstitute a proof that the decoupled theory is a non-commutative\nfield theory.\n\nA physical criteria for non-commutativity is the Moyal-like phase\nfactor in scattering amplitudes.  Scattering amplitudes of open\nstrings ending on a D-brane can be computed along the lines reviewed\nin \\cite{Hashimoto:1996bf}.  In the case of the constant\nnon-commutativity parameter, one can show very explicitly that\n%\n\\be \\langle e^{i p^1 x(\\tau_1)} e^{i p^2 x(\\tau_2)} \\ldots e^{i p^n x(\\tau_n)}\\rangle_{G,\\theta} = e^{-{i \\over 2} \\sum_{n > m} p_i^n \\theta^{ij} p_j^m \\epsilon(\\tau_n-\\tau_m)}\n\\langle e^{i p^1 x(\\tau_1)} e^{i p^2 x(\\tau_2)} \\ldots e^{i p^n x(\\tau_n)}\\rangle_{G,\\theta=0}\\label{master}\\ee\n%\nwhich implies that the scattering amplitudes receive corrections in\nthe form of the Moyal phase factor\n\\cite{Chu:1998qz,Schomerus:1999ug,Seiberg:1999vs}. The goal of this\narticle is to derive the analogous statement (\\ref{melvinMoyal}) for\nthe model of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. Once\n(\\ref{melvinMoyal}) is established in polar coordinates, the\nconnection to Kontsevich formula follows from performing a change of\ncoordinates to the rectangular coordinate system and a non-local field\nredefinition as is described in\n\\cite{Cerchiai:2003yu,Hashimoto:2005hy}.\n\nA useful first step in this exercise is to reproduce the master\nrelation (\\ref{master}) in a slightly different formalism than what\nwas used in \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}.  Let us begin by constructing the\nclosed string background as follows. Start with flat space\n%\n\\be ds^2 = dy'^2 + d\\tilde z^2 \\ ,  \\ee\n%\nwhere $y$ and $\\tilde z$ are compactified with period $L = 2 \\pi R$. Then,\n%\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[{\\bf I}]\nT-dualize along the $z$ direction so that the metric becomes \n%\n\\be ds^2 = dy'^2 + d z^2 \\ .  \\ee\n%\n%\n\\item[{\\bf II}] Twist by shifting the coordinates $y' = y + \\eta z$\n%\n\\be ds^2 = (dy+ \\eta dz)^2 + d z^2 \\ . \\ee\n%\n\\item[{\\bf III}] T-dualize on $z$ so that\n%\n\\be ds^2 = {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2}(dy^2 + d \\tilde z^2), \\qquad B = {\\eta \\over 1 + \\eta^2} dy \\wedge d \\tilde z \\ . \\ee\n%\nThe open string metric associated to this background is\n%\n\\be G_{\\mu \\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = dy^2 + d \\tilde z^2, \\qquad \\theta^{y \\tilde z} = 2 \\pi \\Delta^2 \\ee\n%\nif we scale\n%\n\\be \\Delta^2 = \\alpha' \\eta \\ . \\ee\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n%\nThe transformation of the coordinates and the orientation of the branes are illustrated in figure \\ref{figa}.  This sequence of dualities was referred to as the ``Melvin shift twist'' in \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics{coordinates}}\n\\caption{In {\\bf I} and {\\bf II}, the thick line denotes a D2-brane,\nand the dotted line is the minimum energy configuration of the open\nstrings ending on the D2-branes.  The {\\bf I} and {\\bf II} are related\nby coordinate transformation $y' = y + \\eta z$.  {\\bf III} is the\nT-dual of {\\bf II}, and the shaded region in {\\bf III} denotes a\nD3-brane.\\label{figa}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe approach of \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs} was to work directly in the\nduality frame {\\bf III}, but one can just as easily work in a\nframework which makes the T-duality between duality frame {\\bf II}\nand {\\bf III} manifest, by working with a sigma model of the form \n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1  d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + 2 \\eta \\partial_a y V_b + (1 + \\eta^2) V_a V_b\\right) + i \\epsilon^{ab} \\partial_a \\tilde z  V_b \\right]\\label{sig1}\\ee\n%\nwhere we have chosen to work in conformal gauge in Eucledian\nsignature. This action utilizes the Bushar's formulation of T-duality\n\\cite{Buscher:1987qj}. To see this more explicitly, consider integrating out the field $\\tilde z$. This imposes the constraint\n%\n\\be d V = 0 \\rightarrow V_a = \\partial_a z \\ee\n%\nwhich brings the action (\\ref{sig1}) into the form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + 2 \\eta \\partial_a y \\partial_b z + (1 + \\eta^2) \\partial_a z \\partial_b z \\right)  \\right]\\label{sig2}\\ee\n%\nwhich is the sigma model for the duality frame {\\bf II}. On the other hand, integrating out $V$ first gives rise to a sigma model of the form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[\\left( {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2}\\right) {1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + \\partial_a \\tilde z \\partial_b \\tilde z \\right)  + i \\left({\\eta \\over 1 + \\eta^2}\\right)\\epsilon^{ab} \\partial_a y \\partial_b \\tilde z \\right]\\label{sig3}\\ee\n%\nwhich is the string action for the duality frame {\\bf III}.\n\nIn extracting non-commutative gauge theory as a decoupling limit, we\nare interested in embedding a D-brane extended along the $y$ and\n$\\tilde z$ coordinates in the duality frame {\\bf III}.  We must\ntherefore take the sigma model to be defined on a Riemann surface with\none boundary, which we take to be the upper half plane.  It is also\nnecessary to impose the appropriate boundary condition for all of the\nworld sheet fields. We impose the boundary condition which is free\nalong the $y$ direction and Dirichlet along the $z$ direction:\n%\n\\be \\left.\\partial_n y(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)+ \\eta V_n(\\sigma,\\bar\\sigma)\\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} = 0 \\label{bc0} \\ , \\ee\n\\be \\left. V_t \\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma}  = \\left. \\partial_t z \\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} = 0 \\label{bc1} \\ . \\ee\n%\nUsing the equation of motion from the variation of $V_a$ field\n%\n\\be \\eta \\partial_b y + (1 + \\eta^2) V_b + i \\epsilon_{ab} \\partial_a \\tilde z = 0 \\, \\label{bc2}\\ee\n%\nand (\\ref{bc1}), we infer \n%\n\\be  \\partial_n \\tilde z - i \\eta \\partial_t  y = 0 \\label{bc3}\\ .  \\ee\n%\nThe boundary conditions (\\ref{bc0}) and (\\ref{bc3}) are precisely the\nboundary condition imposed in the analysis of \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}.\n\nIn order to complete the derivation of (\\ref{master}), we add a source term\n%\n\\be e^{- S_{source}} = \\prod_n e^{i k_{yn} y(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n,\\bar\\sigma_n)}  =\ne^{\\sum_n (i k_{yn} y(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n))} \\ee\n%\nto the action (\\ref{sig1}).  Integrating out the $V$ fields and\nbringing the sigma model (\\ref{sig1}) into duality frame {\\bf III}\nwould lead to identical computation as what was described in\n\\cite{Seiberg:1999vs} to derive (\\ref{master}).  We will show below\nthat the same conclusion can be reached using a slightly different\nargument which turns out to easily generalize to the case of Melvin\ndeformed theories \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}.\n\nThe approach we take here is to go to the duality frame {\\bf I}. This brings the sigma model (\\ref{sig1}) to a simpler form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y' \\partial_b y' +  \\partial_a z \\partial_b z\\right)  \\right]\\label{sig4}\\ . \\ee\n%\nThe $\\tilde z$ field in the vertex operator now plays the role of a\ndisorder operator of the dual field $z$. It has the effect of shifting\nthe Dirichlet boundary condition, incorporating the fact that strings\nare stretched along the $z$ direction in frames {\\bf I} and {\\bf\nII}. Also, the fact that the periodicity in $(y',z)$ coordinate system\nare twisted\n%\n\\be (y',z) = (y'+\\eta L n, z+L n) \\ee\n%\nrequires an insertion of a disorder operator for the\n$y'(\\sigma,\\bar\\sigma)$ field as well. We therefore find that the\nsource term has the form\n%\n\\be e^{- S_{source}} = \\prod_n e^{i k_{yn} y'(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i \\eta k_{zn} \\tilde y'(\\sigma_n, \\bar \\sigma_n)- i \\eta k_{yn} z(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n)}  \\ . \\ee\n%\nThe boundary condition is now simply Neumann for $y'$ \n%\n\\be \\left.\\partial_n y'(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = 0\\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} \\ , \\label{neu} \\ee\n%\nand Dirichlet for $z$ \n%\n\\be \\left.\\partial_t z(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = 0 \\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} \\ . \\label{dir} \\ee\n%\nIn this form, $y'$ and the $z$ sector decouple, allowing their\ncorrelators to be computed separately. In order to compute the\ncorrelation functions involving order and disorder operators with\nboundary conditions (\\ref{neu}) and (\\ref{dir}), it is convenient to\ndecompose the fields into holomorphic and anti holomorphic parts\n%\n\\be y'(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = y'(\\sigma) + \\bar y'(\\bar \\sigma)\\ , \\qquad\n\\tilde y'(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = y'(\\sigma) - \\bar y'(\\bar \\sigma)\\ , \\ee\n\\be z(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = z(\\sigma) + \\bar z(\\bar \\sigma)\\ , \\qquad\n\\tilde z'(\\sigma, \\bar \\sigma) = z(\\sigma) - \\bar z(\\bar \\sigma) \\ . \\ee\n%\nTheir correlation functions are given by\n%\n\\be \\langle y'(\\sigma_1) y'(\\sigma_2) \\rangle  = -{1 \\over 2} \\alpha' \\log(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2) \\ee\n\\be \\langle \\bar y'(\\sigma_1) \\bar y'(\\sigma_2) \\rangle\n=  -{1 \\over 2} \\alpha'\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2) \\ee\n\\be \\langle \\bar y'(\\bar \\sigma_1) y'(\\sigma_2) \\rangle =\n - {1 \\over 2} \\alpha'\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2) \\ee\n\\be \\langle z(\\sigma_1) z(\\sigma_2) \\rangle  = \n-{1 \\over 2}\\alpha'\\log(\\sigma_1 -\n \\sigma_2) \\ee\n\\be \\langle \\bar z (\\bar \\sigma_1) \\bar z(\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n=  -{1 \\over 2}\\alpha' \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2) \\ee\n\\be \\langle \\bar z(\\bar \\sigma_1) z(\\sigma_2) \\rangle =\n {1 \\over 2}\\alpha'\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2), \\ee\n%\n%\nfrom which we infer\n%\n\\be  \\langle  y'(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) y'(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle=  -{1 \\over 2} \\alpha'(\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor1}  \\ee\n%\n\\be \\langle \\tilde y'(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) y'(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n=  - {1 \\over 2} \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor2} \\ee\n%\n\\be  \\langle \\tilde y'(\\sigma_1,\\bar\\sigma_1) \\tilde y'(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n =  - {1 \\over 2}  \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor3} \\ee\n%\n\\be  \\langle \\tilde z(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) \\tilde z(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle=  -{1 \\over 2} \\alpha'(\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor4} \\ee\n%\n\\be \\langle z(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) \\tilde z(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n=  - {1 \\over 2} \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor5} \\ee\n%\n\\be  \\langle z(\\sigma_1,\\bar\\sigma_1) z(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n =  - {1 \\over 2}  \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor6} \\ . \\ee\n\n\n\n%\nIn terms of these correlation functions, one can easily show that\n%\n\\beq \\lefteqn{\\langle {\\cal O}(\\sigma_1, \\bar \\sigma_1) {\\cal\nO}(\\sigma_2, \\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle}\\label{corr1} \\\\\n& =& {1 \\over 2} \\alpha' (k_{y1} k_{y2} + k_{z1} k_{z2}) (\\log(\\sigma_1 -\n\\sigma_2) + \\log(\\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2) + \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 -\n\\sigma_2) + \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2)) \\nonumber \\cr\n&& - \\eta \\alpha' (k_{y1} k_{z2} - k_{y2} k_{z1}) (\\log(\\sigma_1 -\n\\bar \\sigma_2) -  \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)) \\nonumber\\cr\n&&\n+{1 \\over 2}\\eta^2  \\alpha' (k_{y1} k_{y2} + k_{z1} k_{z2}) (\\log(\\sigma_1 -\n\\sigma_2) - \\log(\\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2) - \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 -\n\\sigma_2) + \\log(\\bar \\sigma_1 - \\bar \\sigma_2)) \\nonumber\n\\eeq\n%\nfor \n%\n\\be {\\cal O}_n(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) = \ni k_{yn} y'(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i \\eta k_{zn} \\tilde y'(\\sigma_n, \\bar \\sigma_n)- i \\eta k_{yn} z(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) \\ . \n\\ee\n%\nWhen these operators are pushed toward the boundary\n%\n\\be \\sigma \\rightarrow \\tau + 0^+ i \\ , \\ee\n%\nthe correlation function (\\ref{corr1}) reduces to\n%\n\\be \\langle {\\cal O}(\\tau_1) {\\cal\nO}(\\tau_2) \\rangle\n = 2 \\alpha' (k_{y1} k_{y2} + k_{z1} k_{z2}) \\log(\\tau_1 -\n\\tau_2)\n -  \\pi i   \\eta \\alpha' (k_{y1} k_{z2} - k_{y2} k_{z1}) \\epsilon(\\tau_2 - \\tau_1) \\label{OOcorr}\\ee\n%\nwhere $\\epsilon(\\tau)$, following the notation of \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}, is a function which takes the values $\\pm 1$ depending on the sign of $\\tau$.

We will\nconsider the simplest case of embedding (\\ref{melvinbg}) into bosonic\nstring theory.

It is still the case that $(\\varphi',z)$\nsector, for some fixed $r(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)$, is non-interacting. We\nwill exploit this fact and do the path integral in the order where we\nintegrate over $\\varphi'$ and $z$ first.\n%\nThe two point function of $\\varphi'$ formally has the form\n%\n\\be \\langle \\varphi'(\\sigma_1, \\bar \\sigma_1)\\varphi'(\\sigma_2, \\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle = (\\partial r^2(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma) \\partial)^{-1} \\ .  \\ee\n%\nThen, it follows that\n%\n\\be \\langle \\varphi'(\\sigma_1, \\bar \\sigma_1)\\partial^a \\tilde \\varphi'(\\sigma_2, \\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle = i \\epsilon^{ab} (\\partial^b)^{-1}  \n\\ee\n%\nfrom which it follows \n%\n\\be \\langle \\tilde \\varphi'(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) \\varphi'(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n= - {1 \\over 2} \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor7} \\ee\n%\nin complete analogy with (\\ref{coor2}). The correlator (\\ref{coor7})\ntells us that while the field-field correlator $\\langle \\varphi' \\varphi'\n\\rangle$ is complicated and $r$ dependent, the field/disorder field\ncorrelator $\\langle \\tilde \\varphi' \\varphi' \\rangle$ stays simple and\ntopological.\n\nWe can then proceed to compute the analogue of (\\ref{OOcorr}) and\n(\\ref{OOope}) for the operator (\\ref{melvinO}) in the $(\\varphi',z)$\nsector.  While we do not explicitly compute the $\\langle \\tilde \\varphi'\n\\tilde \\varphi' \\rangle$ correlator which appear at order $\\eta^2$ in\n(\\ref{OOcorr}), it is clear that the boundary condition forces this\nterm to vanish as was the case in the earlier example.  The term of\norder $\\eta$ in the exponential can be made to take the Moyal-like\nform\n%\n\\be e^{{i \\over 2}  \\sum_{a < b} (2 \\pi \\Delta) (m_a k_{zb} - k_{za} m_b) \\epsilon(\\tau_b-\\tau_a)}  \\label{melvinMoyal}\\ee\n%\nwhich is finite in the scaling limit $\\alpha' \\rightarrow 0$ with\n%\n\\be \\eta = {\\Delta \\over \\alpha'} \\ee\n%\nkeeping $\\Delta$ finite. This is precisely the scaling considered in\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. The dependence on $r(\\sigma,\n\\bar \\sigma)$ drops out for this term of order $\\eta$, allowing us to\nfurther path integrate over this field trivially, with the only effect\nof $\\eta$ being the overall phase factor (\\ref{melvinMoyal}).  This\nestablishes that the decoupled theory of D-branes in Melvin universes\nconsidered in \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy} has an\neffective dynamics which includes the Moyal-like phase factor\ninvolving the angular momentum quantum number $m$ and the momentum\n$k_z$. In Cartesian coordinates, this Moyal phase corresponds to a\nposition dependent non-commutativity\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. This analysis extends\nstraight forwardly to other simple models of position dependent\nnon-commutativity, such as\\footnote{Using the terminology of\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.} the ``Melvin Null Twist''\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2002nr} and ``Null Melvin Twist''\n\\cite{Dolan:2002px}. It would be interesting to extend this analysis\nto superstrings and to consider the scattering of states other than\nthe open string tachyon.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n%\nWe would like to thank\n%\nI.~Ellwood and \nO.~Ganor\n%\nfor discussions.\n%\nThis work was supported in part by the DOE grant DE-FG02-95ER40896 and\nfunds from the University of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliography{melvin}\\bibliographystyle{utphys}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{document}\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is shown that the cross\nsections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower\nenergies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and\nCoulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low\nas 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for\nstudies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{25.60.-t, 25.70.-z, 25.70.De} \\keywords{Coulomb excitation,\ncross sections, unstable nuclei.} \\maketitle\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\nUnstable nuclei are often studied with reactions induced by\nsecondary radioactive beams. Examples of these reactions are elastic\nscattering, fragmentation and Coulomb excitation by heavy targets.\nCoulomb excitation is specially useful since the interaction\nmechanism is very well known \\cite{AW75}. It is the result of\nelectromagnetic interactions of a projectile ($Z_{P}$,$A_{P}$) with\na target ($Z_{T}$,$A_{T}$). One of the participating nuclei is\nexcited as it passes through the electromagnetic field of the other.\nHere we will only consider the excitation of the projectile as is of\ninterest in studies carried out in heavy ion facilities around the\nworld, e.g. LNS/Catania, NSCL/MSU, GSI, GANIL, RIKEN, etc. In\nCoulomb excitation a virtual photon with energy $E$ is absorbed by\nthe projectile. Because in pure Coulomb excitation the participating\nnuclei stay outside the range of the nuclear strong force, the\nexcitation cross section can be expressed in terms of the same\nmultipole matrix elements that characterize excited-state gamma-ray\ndecay, or the reduced transition probabilities,\n$B(\\pi\\lambda;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f})$. Hence, Coulomb excitation\namplitudes are strongly coupled with valuable nuclear structure\ninformation. Therefore, this mechanism has been used for many years\nto study the electromagnetic properties of low-lying nuclear\nstates~\\cite{AW75}.\n\nCoulomb excitation cross sections are large if the adiabacity parameter\nsatisfies the condition\n\\begin{equation}\n\\xi=\\omega_{fi}\\dfrac{a_{0}}{v}<1\\ , \\label{1.1}%\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $a_{0}$ is half \\ the distance of closest approach in a\nhead-on collision for a projectile velocity $v$, and\n$E_{x}=\\hbar\\omega_{fi}$ is the excitation energy. This adiabatic\ncut-off limits the possible excitation energies below 1-2 MeV in\nsub-barrier collisions. A possible way to overcome this limitation,\nand to excite high-lying states, is to use higher projectile\nenergies. In this case, the closest approach distance, at which the\nnuclei still interact only electromagnetically, is of order of the\nsum of the nuclear radii, $R=R_{P}+R_{T}$, where $P$ refers to the\nprojectile and $T$ to the target. For very high energies one has\nalso to take into account the Lorentz contraction\nof the interaction time by means of the Lorentz factor $\\gamma=(1-v^{2}%\n/c^{2})^{-1/2}$, with $c$ being the speed of light. For such collisions the\nadiabacity condition, Eq.~(\\ref{1.1}), becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\xi(R)=\\frac{\\omega_{fi}R}{\\gamma v}<1\\ . \\label{1.3}%\n\\end{equation}\nFrom this relation one obtains that for bombarding energies around\nand above 100 MeV/nucleon, states with energy up to 10-20 MeV can be\nreadily excited \\cite{WA79}.\n\nAn appropriate description of Coulomb excitation at intermediate\nenergies ($E_{lab}=10-500$ MeV/nucleon) has been described in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}. In this energy region neither the non-relativistic\nCoulomb excitation formalism described in ref. \\cite{AW75}, nor the\nrelativistic one formulated in refs. \\cite{WA79,BB85} are\nappropriate. This is discussed in details in ref. \\cite{Ber03} where\nit is shown that the correct values of the Coulomb excitation cross\nsections differ by up to 30-40\\% when compared to the\nnon-relativistic and relativistic treatments used to calculate\nexperimental observables (cross sections, gamma-ray angular\ndistributions, etc.).\n\nWe follow the formalism of ref. \\cite{Ber03} to calculate cross\nsections for Coulomb excitation from energies varying from 10 to 500\nMeV/nucleon. These are the energies where most radioactive beam\nfacilities are or will be operating around the world. The calculated\ncross sections will be of useful guide for future experiments. We\nalso compare the accurate calculations with those obtained by using\nsimple analytical formulas and test the regime of their validity.\n\nThe cross sections for the transition $J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f}$ in\nthe projectile are calculated using the equation  \\cite{Ber03}\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d\\sigma_{i\\rightarrow f}}{d\\Omega}}=\\frac{4\\pi^{2}Z_{T}^{2}e^{2}}%\n{\\hbar^{2}}\\;a^{2}\\epsilon^{4}\\;\\sum_{\\pi\\lambda\\mu}{\\dfrac{B(\\pi\\lambda\n,J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f})}{(2\\lambda+1)^{3}}}\\;\\mid S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)\\mid\n^{2}\\ , \\label{cross_2}%\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\pi=E$ or $M$ stands for the electric or magnetic multipolarity, and\n\\begin{equation}\nB(\\pi\\lambda,J_{i}\\longrightarrow J_{f})=\\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1}\\ \\left\\vert\n\\left\\langle J_{f}\\left\\Vert \\mathbf{\\mathcal{M}}(\\pi\\lambda)\\right\\Vert\nJ_{i}\\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^{2}\\ \\label{reduced}%\n\\end{equation}\nare the reduced transition probabilities. In these equations, $\\epsilon\n=1/\\sin(\\Theta/2)$, with $\\Theta$ being the deflection angle, $a_{0}%\n={Z_{P}Z_{T}e^{2}/}m_{0}v^{2}$ and $a=a_{0}/\\gamma$. The complex\nfunctions $S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)$ are integrals along Coulomb\ntrajectories corrected for retardation. Their calculation and how\nthey relate to the non-relativistic and relativistic theories are\ndescribed in details in ref. \\cite{Ber03}. Here we will introduce\nanother comparison tool for the total cross section, which is\nobtained by integration of eq. \\ref{cross_2} over scattering angles.\nThe code COULINT \\cite{Ber03} was used to calculate the orbital\nintegrals $S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)$ and the cross sections of eq.\n\\ref{cross_2} (for more details, see ref. \\cite{Ber03}).\n\nUsing the theory described in ref. \\cite{BB85}, it is easy to show that\napproximate values of the cross sections for E1, E2, and M1 transitions can be\nobtained by means of the relations%\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_{E1}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{32\\pi^{2}}{9}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\hbar\nc}B\\left(  E1\\right)  \\left(  \\frac{c}{v}\\right)  ^{2}\\left[  \\xi K_{0}%\nK_{1}-\\frac{v^{2}\\xi^{2}}{2c^{2}}\\left(  K_{1}^{2}-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right]\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\sigma_{E2}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{75}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\left(\n\\hbar c\\right)  ^{3}}E_{x}^{3}B\\left(  E2\\right)  \\left(  \\frac{c}{v}\\right)\n^{4}\\left[  \\frac{2}{\\gamma^{2}}K_{1}^{2}+\\xi\\left(  1+\\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}%\n}\\right)  ^{2}K_{0}K_{1}-\\frac{v^{4}\\xi^{2}}{2c^{4}}\\left(  K_{1}^{2}%\n-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\\sigma_{M1}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{32\\pi^{2}}{9}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\hbar\nc}B\\left(  M1\\right)  \\left[  \\xi K_{0}K_{1}-\\frac{\\xi^{2}}{2}\\left(\nK_{1}^{2}-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right]  , \\label{approx}%\n\\end{align}\nwhere $K_{n}$ are the modified Bessel functions of the second order, as a\nfunction of $\\xi$ given by eq. \\ref{1.3}, with $R$ corrected for recoil by the\nmodification $R\\rightarrow R+\\pi a/2$ \\cite{WA79}.\n\nHere we will only consider the excitation of the lowest lying states\nin light and medium heavy nuclei. For nuclear masses $A<20$, the\nTUNL nuclear data evaluation web site was of great help \\cite{tunl}.\nThe electromagnetic transition rates at the TUNL database are given\nin Weisskopf units and are transformed to the appropriate\n$B(\\pi\\lambda,I_{i}\\rightarrow I_{f})$-values by means of the\nstandard Weisskopf relations $B_W(E1;J_{i}\\rightarrow\nJ_{gs})=0.06446A^{2/3}$\ne$^{2}$fm$^{2}$, $B_W(E2;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{gs})=0.05940A^{4/3}$ e$^{2}$%\nfm$^{4}$, and $B_W(M1;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{gs})=1.79\\left(  e\\hbar/2m_{n}%\nc\\right)  ^{2}$. For comparison, a few medium mass nuclei, as well\nas a few stable nuclei, were included in the calculation. Other data\nwere taken from refs. \\cite{Mot95,Sch96,Gad03,Im04}.\n\nSome cases of nuclei far from the stability line are very\ninteresting and deserve further study, possibly using the method of\nCoulomb excitation. For example, it is well known that nuclei with\nopen shells tend to have $B(E2)$ values greater than 10 W.u.,\nwhereas nuclei with shell closure of neutrons or protons tend to\nhave distinctly smaller $B(E2)$ values. Typical examples of the\nlatter category are the doubly magic nuclei, $^{16}$O and $^{48}$Ca,\nwhich $B(E2)$ values are 3.17 and 1.58 W.u., respectively. According\nto an empirical formula adjusted to a global fit of the known\ntransition rates, the\nvalues of first excited $2^{+}$ level, $E_{2^{+}}$, and $B(E2;0^{+}%\n\\rightarrow2^{+})$ are related by \\cite{Ra88} ($E_{2^+}$ in keV)\n\\begin{equation}\nB(E2;0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+})=26\\frac{Z^{2}}{A^{2/3}E_{2^{+}}}\\text{ e}%\n^{2}\\text{fm}^{4}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nThe value of $B(E2)$ for $^{16}$C based on this formula is at least\none order of magnitude larger than what is observed experimentally\nin a Coulomb dissociation experiment \\cite{Im04}. The anomalously\nstrong hindrance of the $^{16}$C transition is not well explained\ntheoretically. This is just an example of the power of Coulomb\nexcitation as a tool to access the new physics inherent of poorly\nknown rare nuclear species.\n\nAnother example is the strong $E1$ transition in $^{11}$Be.\n$^{11}$Be is an archetype of a halo nucleus and exhibits the fastest\nknown dipole transition between bound states in nuclei. The $B(E1)$\ntransition strength between the ground and the only bound excited\nstate (at 0.32 MeV) was determined from lifetime measurements by\nMillener et al. to be 0.116 e$^{2}$fm$^{2}$ \\cite{Mi83}. However,\nCoulomb excitation experiments have obtained a much smaller value of\nthe $B(E1)$ which is still a matter of investigation\n\\cite{BCH95,Hus06,Cha07}. It is thus seems clear that predictions based on\ntraditional nuclear structure and reaction theory often yields\nresults in disagreement with experimental data. In spite of that,\nwhen proper corrections are accounted for (e.g. channel-coupling,\nnuclear excitation, relativistic corrections), Coulomb excitation of\nradioactive beams is a powerful complementary tool to investigate\nelectromagnetic properties of nuclei far from the stability line.\n\nIn Table 1 we compare our calculations with several experimentally\nobtained cross sections for Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei.\nThe units of energy are MeV, the laboratory energy is in\nMeV/nucleon, the B-values are in units of e$^{2}$ fm$^{2\\lambda}$,\nand the cross sections are in millibarns. The last two columns give\nthe calculated cross sections obtained by using eqs. \\ref{cross_2}\nand \\ref{approx}, respectively. Since the cross sections of  eq.\n\\ref{approx} are functions of the minimum impact parameter, the\nvalues reported in the Table have been calculated according to the\nexperimental angular ranges reported in the seventh column. Except\nfor the $^{11}$Be case, for which the discrepancy between theory and\nexperiment is known (see discussion above), the calculated cross\nsections are close to the experimental values. Nonetheless, the\ncalculated cross sections tend to be smaller than the experimental\nones for $^{17}$Ne, $^{32}$Mg, $^{38}$S, $^{40}$S, $^{42}$S,\n$^{44}$Ar, and $^{46}$Ar projectiles. This is worrisome because the\nB($\\pi\\lambda$) values were extracted from the experimentally\nobtained cross sections, using equations similar to eq.\n\\ref{approx}. These experimental B-values would have to be larger by\n$10-30$\\% according to our calculations.\n\nIt is important to stress the fact that many experimental data on\nunstable nuclei collected up to now have been analyzed by means of\ntheoretical tools (DWBA and coupled-channels codes) which do not\ninclude relativistic {\\it dynamics} (the inclusion of relativistic\n{\\it kinematics} is straightforward). This problem was first\naddressed in ref. \\cite{Ber05}, where it was shown that the analysis\nof experimental data at intermediate energies without a proper\ntreatment of relativistic dynamics leads to wrong values of\nelectromagnetic transition probabilities. We should stress that a\nfull theoretical treatment of relativistic dynamics of strong and\nelectromagnetic interactions in many-body systems is very difficult\nand still does not exist \\cite{Ber05}.\n\n\\begin{tabular}\n[c]{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}\\hline\nData & Projectile & Target & E$_{\\text{lab}}$ & $\\pi\\lambda$ & B($\\pi\\lambda\n$) & $\\theta_{\\text{range}}$ & E$_{x}$ & $\\sigma_{\\exp}$ & $\\sigma_{\\text{th}%\n}$ & $\\sigma_{\\text{app}}$\\\\\\hline\\hline 1 \\cite{Ann95} & $^{11}$Be\n& Pb & 43. & E1 & 0.115 & $<5^{\\circ}$ & 0.32\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$) & $191\\pm26$ & 328. &\n323.\\\\\\hline 2 \\cite{Ann95} & $^{11}$Be & Pb & 59.4 & E1 & 0.094 &\n$<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32 ($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$)\n& $304\\pm43$ & 213. & 211.\\\\\\hline 3  \\cite{Fau97} & $^{11}$Be & Au\n& 57.6 & E1 & 0.079 & $<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$) & $244\\pm31$ & 170. &\n168.\\\\\\hline 4 \\cite{Nak97} & $^{11}$Be & Pb & 64. & E1 & 0.099 &\n$<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32 ($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$)\n& $302\\pm31$ & 217. & 215.\\\\\\hline 5 \\cite{Ch97,Ch02} & $^{17}$Ne &\nAu & 60. & M1 & 0.163 & $<4.5^{\\circ}$ & 1.29\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{-}\\rightarrow\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$) & $12\\pm4$ & 12.6 &\n13.0\\\\\\hline 6 \\cite{Mot95} & $^{32}$Mg & Pb & 49.2 & E2 & 454 &\n$<4^{\\circ}$ & 0.885 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $91.7\\pm14.4$ &\n137. & 128.\\\\\\hline 7 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{38}$S & Au & 39.2 & E2 & 235\n& $<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.29 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $59\\pm7$ & 48. &\n45.0\\\\\\hline 8 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{40}$S & Au & 39.5 & E2 & 334 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 0.91 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $94\\pm9$ & 75.5 &\n70.4\\\\\\hline 9 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{42}$S & Au & 40.6 & E2 & 397 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 0.89 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $128\\pm19$ & 101.\n& 94.3\\\\\\hline 10 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{44}$Ar & Au & 33.5 & E2 & 345 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.14 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $81\\pm9$ & 62.3 &\n58.3\\\\\\hline 11 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{46}$Ar & Au & 35.2 & E2 & 196 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.55 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $53\\pm10$ & 40.9 &\n38.2\\\\\\hline 12 \\cite{Gad03} & $^{46}$Ar & Au & 76.4 & E2 & 212 &\n$<2.9^{\\circ}$ & 1.55 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $68\\pm8$ & 50.0 &\n47.4\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\medskip\n\nTable 1.

These cross sections were\ncalculated assuming that the detectors collect events from all\npossible Coulomb scattering events. In a real experimental\nsituation, the angular distribution is restricted to angular\nwindows, reducing the available cross sections. Only the lowest\nlying transitions have been considered, i.e. from the ground to the\nfirst excited states. One observes that some cross sections are very\nlarge, specially for $^{11}$Be, $^{18}$Ne, $^{30}$Ne and $^{54}$Ni.\nFor these and other similar cases, the measurements are easy to\nperform, with a large number of events/second even with modest\nintensities. Cases such as $^{16}$C are well within the experimental\npossibilities in most radioactive beam facilities.\n\nTable 2 also shows that, except for M1 excitations, the Coulomb\nexcitation cross sections decrease steadily as the energy increases\nfrom 10 to 500 MeV/nucleon. Based on these numbers alone, one could\nconclude that Coulomb excitation of low-lying states (in contrast to\nthe case of high-lying states, e.g. giant resonances \\cite{BB85})\nare better suited for studies at low energies. However, reactions at\nlower energies while are less influenced by contamination due to\nnuclear breakup \\cite{BCH95,Cha07} can give rise to large high-order\neffects \\cite{BC92}. The interpretation of data could be distorted\nas in the case of Coulomb dissociation of $^8$B at low energy\n\\cite{Kolata}, which was completely misinterpreted in terms of\nfirst-order calculations. In some situations, when higher-order\neffects are relevant, the effect of the nuclear breakup cannot be\nneglected either \\cite{Gai,Vitturi}. Thus, the choice of the\nincident energy would depend on the experimental conditions.\nIdentification of gamma-rays from de-excitation using Doppler shift\ntechniques are often more advantageous at higher energies. Moreover,\nexcept for few cases (e.g. $^{11}$C), the magnetic dipole\ntransitions are much smaller than those for $E1$ and $E2$\ntransitions. Even for M1 transitions the measurements are under the\npossibility of most new experimental facilities.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[ptb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[\nheight=4.0906in, width=4.3154in ]{fig2.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross section of \\ the first excited state in\n$^{11}$Be, $^{11}$B and $^{54}$Ni and of the 13.05 MeV sate in $^{16}$O\nprojectiles incident on Pb targets as a function of the laboratory energy.}%\n\\label{fig2}%\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\bigskip\n\nThe comparison of the exact calculations, using eq. \\ref{cross_2}\n(solid lines), and the approximations \\ref{approx} (dashed lines)\nare shown in figs. 2(a-d), for $^{11}$Be, $^{11}$B, $^{54}$Ni and\n$^{16}$O, respectively. The $^{16}$O case (as well as for $^{12}$C\nin Table 2) was included for comparison, with a high-lying excited\nstate. We see from figs 2a and 2b that the approximations in eq.\n\\ref{approx} work quite well for the $M1$ multipolarity and\nreasonably well (within 20\\% at 10 MeV/nucleon and 5\\% at 50\nMeV/nucleon) for the $E1$ cases. But they fail badly at low and\nintermediate energies for the $E2$ ( fig. 2c). The reason is that\nthe $E2$ Coulomb field (\\textquotedblleft tidal\nfield\\textquotedblright) is very sensitive to the details of the\ncollision dynamics at low energies. These conclusions can be\ndeceiving since even for the $E1$ and $M1$ cases the approximations\nin eq. \\ref{approx} may strongly differ from the exact calculations\nif the excitation energy is large (see discussion in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}). This is shown in figure 2d, where we plot the Coulomb\nexcitation cross section of the $E_{x}=13.09$ MeV state in $^{16}$O.\nIn this case, the cross sections based on eq. \\ref{approx} is a\nfactor of 10 smaller than the exact calculation at 10 MeV/nucleon.\nAt 100 MeV/nucleon this difference drops to 10\\%, which still needs\nto be considered with care.\n\nIn summary, in this article we have used the formalism of ref.\n\\cite{Ber03} to predict the cross sections for Coulomb excitation of\nseveral light projectiles with electromagnetic transitions found in\nthe literature, listed in the TUNL database \\cite{tunl}, and for a\nfew other selected cases. These estimates will be useful for planing\nCoulomb excitation experiments at present and future heavy ion\nfacilities. It is evident that the inclusion of relativistic effects\ncombined with Coulomb distortion are of the utmost relevance. The cross section inferred by using\nnon-relativistic or pure relativistic treatments can be wrong by up\nto 30\\% even at 100 MeV/nucleon, as shown here and in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}. Finally, the use of Coulomb excitation to produce\nnuclei in high-lying states is an important tool to study particle\nemission processes. For example, the excitation of $^{18}$Ne and its\nsubsequent decay by two-proton emission is a process of large\ntheoretical and experimental interest. Experimental work in this\ndirection is in progress \\cite{Ra06}.\n\n\\section*{\\bigskip}\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\textbf{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract\nNo. DE-AC05-00OR22725 (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) with UT-Battelle, LLC.,\nand by DE-FC02-07ER41457 with the University of Washington (UNEDF, SciDAC-2).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}                                                                                               %\n\n\n\\bibitem {AW75}K.~Alder and A.~Winther, Electromagnetic Excitation,\nNorth-Holland, Amsterdam, 1975.\n\n\\bibitem {Ber03}C.A.~Bertulani, A.E.~Stuchbery, T.J.~Mertzimekis and\nA.D.~Davies, Phys.

In the last years, many research groups, with different\nexperimental techniques like non linear magneto-optical\nrotation\\cite{budk_rev02}, spin-exchange relaxation free - Faraday rotation \\cite{romalisSERF}, double resonance optical\npumping \\cite{Groe06}, and Coherent Population Trapping (CPT)\n\\cite{Kna02,NOI} have obtained important records in optical\nmagnetometry  sensitivity, so to prove that atomic magnetometers are\npresently competitive  even with SQUID magnetometers in terms of\nsensitivity, and can find applications in fields like geomagnetism\nmonitoring, testing of materials, testing of fundamental symmetries of\nPhysics and bio-magnetism detection.   \n\nThe first mapping of the cardiomagnetic field with a Rubidium double\nresonance magnetometer has been demonstrated in ref.\\cite{wei03a}, and\ngood agreement with  the magnetocardiogram obtained by a SQUID\nmagnetocardiograph has been found\\cite{wei03b}. \n\nThe unique experiment of M. Romalis and coworkers \\cite{Xia06},\nrecently showed that laser magnetometers can perform records in\nregistration of  such weak (few hundreds fT) magnetic fields as those\nproduced by the human brain activity. \n\nA fundamental request for  actually reaching the  sensitivity level\nneeded for bio-signal detection is to reduce dramatically the\nenvironmental magnetic field. Usually high magnetic permeability\nmaterials like  $\\mu$-metal are employed  to build small volumes\ninside of which  it is possible to have very effective  shielding of\nthe external, undesired magnetic fields. \n\nThe high cost  of such magnetically clean chambers represents a strong\nlimitation for the diffusion  of high sensitive magnetometry in\nclinical application, also because of their delicateness and\npossible magnetization with consequent requirement of periodical\ndemagnetizing treatments.   \n \nThe main limits of working in unshielded environmental conditions,\ntypical in a scientific laboratory, are given by the presence of\nstrong magnetic field gradients, ac magnetic fields in the volume of\nsensor cell and by the magnetic noise produced by other human\nactivities and ionospheric phenomena.  \n\nField gradients  affect the sensitivity limit of the instrument by\nintroducing  a broadening of the detected resonance\nline. Time-dependent magnetic fields represent a further  additional\nsource limiting the magnetic field detection sensitivity.  \n\nThe possibility of achieving high sensitivity, simply by passively\nquenching magnetic noise (placing  thick Al plates around the magnetic\nsensor), has been shown in ref.\\cite{seltz04}. There a sensitivity  of\nthe order of $1\\rm{pT}/\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ is obtained thanks to a\nsophisticated feedback system that, keeping around  zero the total\nmagnetic field value in the volume of a K  cell (heated to\n$170^{\\circ}C$), suppresses the broadening due to\nspin-exchange-collisions.    \n\nIn the present work, we show that a cheap system for eliminating\nspatial inhomogeneities of the background magnetic field, joined to an\naccurately balanced differential detection scheme, allows for\ndetecting the magnetic signal produced by the heart activity\nwithout the use of neither expensive and bulky shielding chambers nor\naluminum shields that attenuate high-frequency magnetic noise. The\ndevice consists in a full optical sensor operating at room\ntemperature, placed inside a frame of compensation coils that can be\neasily accessed by a human body. \n   \n\n\\section{Basics of the measurement principle}\n\\label{principles}\nMagnetic field optical detection is performed by creating\nCPT\\cite{NOI, And03} on   Zeeman sublevels of the F=3 hyperfine\nground state of Cs atoms.  \n\nThis is an all optical technique as it does not require the presence\nof coils in the proximity of the sensor cell in order to produce\ndirect RF magnetic excitation. This feature makes easy to optimize the\nsensitivity to any orientation of the magnetic field, thus allowing\nfor measuring any component of it. CPT is produced  when circularly polarized\nlaser radiation, resonant with a $\\rm{D}_2$ optical transition, is frequency\nmodulated exactly at the Zeeman frequency splitting of the ground\nZeeman sublevels. The CPT signal can be seen as a resonant decrement\nof the absorption in the optical transition. The measure of the\nresonant frequency $\\omega_L$ gives directly an absolute measurement\nof the modulus of the magnetic field interacting with the atomic probe.  \n\n This kind of magnetic field measurement is absolute and\n self-calibrated because the magnetic field strength $B$  is given by: \n$B = \\frac{\\omega_L}{\\mu_0 g_F}$, where  $\\mu_0$ is the Bohr magneton,\n $g_F$ is the Land\\'e factor of the considered ground-state and\n $\\omega_L$ is the resonance  (Larmor) frequency. The magnetometer is\n a scalar one and the  estimation  of the  magnetic field modulus is\n obtained  by scaling  the Larmor frequency by atomic constants, and\n only minor deviations  may occur \\cite{Wyn99}, introducing small\n systematic errors. Long time  living coherence between Zeeman\n sublevels allows for creating  very  narrow (few Hz) resonances and\n then for getting  very sensitive  magnetic field estimations.  Cs\n optical transitions can be excited by means of diode laser\n radiation, that can be easily  modulated in frequency  by means of\n the modulation of its injection  current. Magnetic field intensities in the\n geophysical range, correspond to  frequency modulations of the order\n of 100~kHz. This  gives the  possibility of performing high precision\n magnetic field measurement while  operating in  the presence of the\n local Earth  magnetic field, by  employing  RF modulation of the\n laser current\\cite{budk_mod_02,Aco06, NOI}. \n\nThe presented experimental investigation is dedicated to the\ndetection of a small, time varying  field in the presence of about\n$10^6$ times stronger dc bias field, for any  relative  orientation\nof the two fields. As any scalar magnetometer, our setup is sensitive to the component of the\nvarying magnetic field in the direction of the bias field (see also Section\n\\ref{inhomogeneities}).\n\n\\section{Sensor set-up}\nThe sensor set-up is sketched in Fig.\\ref{setupSINGLEcell}.\nLaser source is a single-mode edge-emitting pigtail laser ($\\lambda$=\n852~nm) with 15~mW of laser power and an intrinsic line-width of\nless than 5~MHz. Laser light is coupled to a single-mode\npolarization-maintaining fiber 10~m in length and the laser head,\ncontaining the laser chip, a 40~dB optical isolator, the temperature\nstability system (Peltier junction and the thermistor), and the fiber \ncollimator is contained into a compact butterfly housing of  $\\mbox\n40~\\textrm{cm}^3$.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi01.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{ Experimental setup.

The beam reflected by IBS1 passes\ntrough a vacuum reference cell and the transmitted light is detected\nin order to monitor the laser frequency tuning with respect to the\nDoppler line. The beam transmitted trough IBS1 is split again by a\nsecond intensity beam splitter IBS2. The  beam reflected by IBS2 is\nmade parallel  to the transmitted one after  reflection on a mirror M\nand plays the role of a second arm of the sensor. The two arms\ninteraxial separation $\\Delta$ is chosen to be about 7 cm.  The\npolarization of both the beams is adjusted by means of two $\\lambda/4$\nplates. Both beams cross, in different points,  a single cell,\ncontaining Cs and 5~Torr of $Ar$ as a buffer gas.  The use of a single\ncylindrical cell, 9~cm in length and 1.5~cm in radius guarantees equal\nconditions for CPT creation (equal Cs and Ar vapor density in the two\nlaser-atoms interaction volumes). All the component represented \nin Fig.\\ref{setupSINGLEcell} are mounted on a non magnetic plate and the \noverall dimensions of the sensor are $25\\times12\\times4$~$\\rm{cm}^3$. \n\nIn order to reduce power broadening, laser power  is reduced to less than\n$50~\\mbox{$\\mu W$}$ in each sensor arm using a set of neutral\nfilters. A non magnetic translating  blade is placed after the\ncell, in front of one (the most sensitive) of the two photo-diodes, in\norder to have the possibility of fine balancing the detected\nphoto-currents. \n \n \nIn order to increase the signal to noise ratio of the detected signal,\nphase sensitive detection is used. At this aim, we impose a 20~kHz\nfrequency modulation on the RF frequency modulating the laser current\nand then detect the component of the signal oscillating at this frequency.  \n\n\\section{Sensitivity optimization for cardio-signal detection}\nThe magnetic field produced by a  human heart is characterized by a\nmaximum intensity of about 100~pT in the close vicinity of the chest,\nand the main features are well reconstructed if sampled in a bandwidth\nof at least 30~Hz \\cite{wei03a}.  \n\nMagnetic heart-beat spatially confined distribution, of the order of the\nheart dimensions, allows for performing differential detection in a\nrather small volume in front of the patient's chest, while the\npossibility of triggering the acquisition on other signal, taken for\nexample from the electro-cardiogram (or even from a simple pulse\noximeter), allows for effective noise rejection in an off-line analysis. \n\nAs introduced before, unshielded environmental conditions limit the\ninstrumental sensitivity essentially because of  the temporal and \nspatial fluctuation of the background magnetic field. Field gradients\nin our laboratory have the typical magnitude of about 100~$\\rm{nT}/\\rm{cm}$\ndepending on the presence of magnetic material both in the\ninstrumentation and in the building structure. Alternating magnetic\nfields contribute instead, mainly with $50~\\rm{Hz}$ and higher odd\norder harmonics, with a typical rms amplitude of the order of 100~nT\ndepending on the vicinity of electric lines and power supply\ntransformers. For  frequencies higher than the lock-in cut-off\nfrequency, ac fields determine  an effective broadening of the CPT\nline, while  for lower frequencies they directly introduce time\nfluctuation  of  the CPT resonance center. Optimization of the\nmagnetometer sensitivity is fundamentally performed on the basis of\nthe spatial and temporal characteristics of the bio-signal to be measured.  \n\nIn order to improve the common mode noise rejection it is important to\nhave, in absence of the magnetic source to be measured, exactly the\nsame resonance profile at the  two inputs of the differential lock-in\namplifier. As shown in Ref.\\cite{Kna02} small differences in  laser\npower, polarization, beam-size contribute significantly to the\nunbalance  by changing the amplitude and the shape (mainly) of the\nCPT resonance. Difference between the magnetic field values inside the\ntwo laser-atom interaction volumes shifts instead the positions of the\nresonances centers.  \n\nThe cardiac signal measurement procedure consists in, first, \nadjustment of  amplitude and width of the CPT signals in the two arms\nseparately (single input mode of the lock-in amplifier) and, second,\nfine optimization of those parameters by looking at the maximum\ncommon mode noise cancellation in the differential signal\n(differential input mode of the lock-in amplifier).     \n\n\n\\subsection{Field inhomogeneities compensation}\n\\label{inhomogeneities}\nAs mentioned in Section \\ref{principles}, measuring the modulus of $B$\nin the presence of a strong dc component, leads to detect only the\nvariations $\\Delta B$ of the field in the component parallel to the dc, bias\nfield since \n$\\Delta \\left|\\vec{B}\\right|\\simeq\n\\frac{\\vec{B}}{\\left|\\vec{B}\\right|}\\cdot\\Delta\\vec{B}$. \n\nBy zeroing two of the three spatial component of the local background\nmagnetic field, one is  able to measure one selected  component of the\nsignal produced by the biological source. This gives the possibility\nof studying   the different components of the measured field and\neventually  reconstructing the entire vectorial signal. \n\nThe typical configuration for  a cardio-signal detection measurement\nis sketched in Fig.\\ref{cubo_paziente}. In this particular\nconfiguration both $x$ and $y$ components of the laboratory\nmagnetic field are compensated (the residual magnetic field is in the\n0.1~${\\rm{\\mu} T}$ range) and thus, the $z$ component of the human \nheart magnetic beat is being detected. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Jbelfi02.eps\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Schematics of the apparatus.  The selected component of the background\nbias field  $B_0$, parallel to $\\hat{z}$ in the scheme, determines the\ndirection of the detected component of the bio-signal, while laser\nbeams separated by  $\\Delta$ are directed along $\\hat{x}$. Dipoles are used\nfor gradients compensation.  \\label{cubo_paziente}} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThis  detection scheme has important advantages in view of simplifying the compensation of \nmagnetic field inhomogeneities. As explained in deeper detail in the Appendix, \nin fact, only 3 currents for the compensation of the spatial gradients inside the cell volume,\nare needed in addiction to the 2 currents employed for the zeroing of\ntwo of the three component of the laboratory magnetic field. These three\ncurrents  flow respectively in one anti-Helmholtz pair  and in two\nsmall coils playing the role of magnetic dipoles. \n\nAfter the optimization of the gradient compensation we get a strong\nreduction of the line broadening due to magnetic field\ninhomogeneities. Fig. \\ref{restringimento}  shows the CPT resonance\nsignal registered with and without the compensation of spatial\ngradients. Without compensation a best fit analysis gives a \nlinewidth (FWHM) of  about 1.7~kHz which is reduced down to less than\n300~Hz in case of gradients compensation.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi03.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{CPT line-shapes produced with circular polarization and\n  magnetic field orientation orthogonal to the laser beam (along\n  $\\widehat{z}$ direction).

Fitted line-width is\n  reduced to 280~Hz.  \\label{restringimento}} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Differential measurement procedure and noise characterization}\n\nDepending on the spatial configuration of the local magnetic field in\ncorrespondence of  the two light-atoms interaction volumes, we are\nable to cancel different noise contributions at the cost of increasing\nthe uncorrelated electronic noise in the detection stage by namely a\nfactor of  $\\sqrt{2}$. Other noise sources, like laser frequency noise\nand amplitude noise are systematically canceled from the signal\nprovided that the two arms are  balanced. If, furthermore, both arms\nof the sensor give CPT resonance exactly at the same resonant\nfrequency, then even the common mode magnetic field noise, generated\nfor example by all far magnetic sources is eliminated. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{cardiac_noise} is presented the magnetometric noise spectral\ndensity for different operating conditions of the device. Trace (a) is\nrelative to a single arm operation: laser noise and magnetic common mode\nnoise contribute entirely. Trace (b) is obtained in differential input\nacquisition, where the two CPT resonances occur at frequencies\nseparated by more than the CPT linewidth. In this case one mainly gets\nthe cancellation of the laser frequency and intensity noise. Evident\ngain in the reduction of residual noise is obtained in the\ndifferential acquisition when CPT resonances detected by the two\nsensors are accurately overlapped (trace (c)).  Trace (d) and (e) are\nrecorded respectively in differential and single input mode, when the\nlaser frequency is tuned  out of the single photon (Doppler) resonance. It\nis evident that the uncorrelated electronic noise increases in the\ndifferential detection.    \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi04.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{a)~Single input acquisition: laser frequency is tuned to the\n  center of the CPT resonance. b)~Differential input acquisition: CPT\n  signals  on the two arms of the sensor are separated by more than\n  the CPT linewidth. c)~Differential input acquisition: CPT signals\n  overlapping is optimized. d)~Out of Doppler absorption resonance\n  noise in differential input mode. e)~Out of Doppler absorption\n  resonance noise in single input mode. In the inset is reported  the total rms noise $N$ integrated betweeen 1 Hz and 30 Hz (cardio-signal bandwidth) relative to each trace.  \\label{cardiac_noise}} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{Cardio signal data analysis}\nThe signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is not high enough to make single\ncardiac pulse directly observable, so that off-line analysis must\ninclude both linear filtration  and averaging of the data. We use a standard\ntechnique for acquiring a  reference signal simultaneously with the\nmagnetometric data. Our digital  lock-in amplifier (Stanford SR830)\nallows for storing up to 16384 data in a  buffer, which can be\nsynchronously acquired using an external clock.  Thus we use an\nexternal DAQ card (MCC 1608FS, 16~bit resolution, with USB  interface)\nwhose ADC operation triggers the lock-in data storage. Such DAQ is\nused to sample reference data produced by either the pulse-oximeter or\nan  electrocardiographic connection.  \n\nIn the case of the pulse-oximeter, we arranged an IR led and a \nphototransistor in such a way  to sense the transparency \nvariation of a finger, and give several hundred mV signal\npeak-to-peak. Alternatively, the ECG was performed by acquiring digitally the\nelectric signal collected by two electrodes placed in the vicinity of\nthe heart, after a passive low-pass filtering, necessary to reduce the\nnoise aliasing. Specifically, as we use typically a 128~S/s\nacquisition rate, a 18~dB/oct filter made with a three-stage RC\ncutting at 40~Hz, produced a clean signal about 1~mV at the  \nQRS complex.\n\nIn both cases, the reference signal needs some preliminary (off-line) \nnumerical conditioning before being used as a trigger. Namely, some linear \nfiltering is performed to remove slow drifts and high frequency noise (a \n3rd order bandpass numerical filter from 0.2~Hz to 30~Hz is usually \nsuitable). After this, the envelope of the reference is evaluated, and used \nto normalize the peak-to-peak amplitude all along the registration. \nFinally, the normalized reference is used to produce a trigger signal \nwhich is adjustable in slope, threshold and hold-off, similarly to standard \noscilloscopes. Additionally, and in particular when using pulse-oximeter \nreference, it is important to adjust a (negative) trigger delay, of\nsome tenths of second, due to the  relevant lag between the heart\npulse and the change on the finger  transparency. Both references\nshowed to be suitable for data average triggering. \n\nThe magnetocardiographic data downloaded from the lock-in data buffer are \nfirstly numerically filtered with the aim of removing specific spectral \ncomponents (such as 50~Hz noise) and other spectral peaks due to artifacts (such as mechanical vibration of the Helmholtz coils) then split in traces \ncorresponding to single heart pulses, from which the average pulse can be \nreconstructed by  averaging.\n\nThe averaging process is not straightforward, due to the fact that the \npulse duration is not stable. We tried two different approaches to superpose and average \nthe single-pulse traces. In the first one, we strengthen the arrays \ncontaining the single pulse traces to a given size by linear\ninterpolation, to make all  of them equal in length; while in the\nsecond procedure we add zeros at  the end of the shorter arrays to\nmake all of them as long as the longest  one. It turns out that the\nsecond procedure is more effective and correct,  due to the fact that\n(as can be seen also by the ECG traces) the traces  corresponding to\nsingle pulse cardiac activity are not similar to each other. \n\nSpecifically, each trace starts with a P-QRS-T complex having a pretty \nstable duration, followed by a quiescent interval whose duration is rather \nvariable in time, which is the main responsible for the\nnon-periodicity of the signal.  As a consequence, using ECG\nreference, one finds that the averaging is the best (and the best\nis the S/N obtained) when triggering on the QRS complex (the highest peak)\nwith a delay suitable to include the P wave of the same beat,\nwhile the location where the quiescent phase is being cut is not\nrelevant, provided that the T wave of the previous beat is not\nincluded. In the case of pulse-oximeter as a reference the correct\ntrigger delay must be found empirically due to its intrinsic additional delay.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{Single_cardiac_pulse} is reported a reconstructed\nmagnetic heart-beat, obtained by placing the sensor close to the chest of\none of the authors. The peak is obtained from a data set consisting in\n16384 points acquired at a sampling rate of 128~Hz. Average is\n thus performed on a set of about 150 heart-beats, corresponding to 128~sec\nof measuring time. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi05.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Reconstructed cardiac pulse.

We discussed simple approaches for\nmagnetic-field and magnetic-field-gradient compensation, as well as\noff-line data analysis of quasi-periodic signals.\nThe noise characterization showed that a severe limitation to the\nsensitivity would be set by the background magnetic field fluctuation,\nwhich, thanks to its essential uniformity can be effectively canceled in\ndifferential measurements. Specific features of the presented\nmagnetometer, compared to others used at present lie in the facts that\nit works at room temperature and can be fast adjusted to detect\ndifferent components of the weak biologic magnetic field vector, as\nthe sensor, being purely optical, does not include coils,  which would\nconstitute geometrical constraints. The simplicity of the method, its low cost\nand low maintenance cost can be a crucial factor for its\ndissemination in clinical applications.\n\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section*{Magnetic-field and gradient compensation}\nIn this appendix, we report the principles of the strategy  for the resonance\nnarrowing, shown in Fig.~\\ref{restringimento}, obtained by means of\nmagnetic field and magnetic field gradient conditioning. \n\nIn order to be able to independently compensate each of the three\ncomponents of the magnetic  field vector, while introducing minimum\ninhomogeneities, it is straightforward to  use three pairs of coils in\nHelmholtz configuration (which for squared  coils means to place them\nat a distance of about 0.544~L, L being the length of the coil side). \n\n\nThe center  of the Cs vapor cell, the core of the optical sensor, is\nthen placed at the geometrical  center of  a \"cube\" composed by a set\nof three pairs of squared ($180\\times180\\,\\rm{cm}^2$) coils\n($180\\times0.544$ is just enough to make possible a human body to\naccess the cube).\n\n%, each coil having inductance L=0.3~Henry, and\n%resistance of  7.5~$\\Omega$. \n  \nBasic arguments  give that not only $\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}$, but\nalso $\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{B}$ is zero in the position of the\nsensor, as no current flows there. As a  direct consequence, only five out of \nthe nine elements of the matrix $\\partial B_i/\\partial x_j$ are \nindependent, i.e. only five parameters have to be controlled for their \ncompensation. More precisely, a complete compensation requires to controll \ntwo of the three diagonal elements, and three of the six \noff-diagonal elements.\n\n\nThe diagonal elements can be compensated by anti-Helmholtz coils. This \nmeans that two additional couples of coils with counter-propagating \ncurrents could be used to compensate $\\partial B_x/\\partial x $ \nand  $\\partial B_y/\\partial y $ (which would guarantee also the \ncompensation of $\\partial B_z/\\partial z $). In principle, such \nanti-Helmholtz coils should be at a larger distance, in order to produce \nthe linear term $\\partial B_i/\\partial x_i$ and not the cubic one. But for \nsimplicity, considering the small corrections to be made, is preferable to \nuse the already existing Helmholtz pairs (with which, by the way, one has \nalso the advantage of producing a maximum gradient, given the current).\n\n\nThis choice leads to simultaneously compensate the $x$ and\n$y$ components of the field and the three diagonal components of  the\ngradient, by separately controlling the currents in the four Helmholtz\ncoils for  $B_x$ and $B_y$ compensation. Specifically, indicating with\n$I_{x1}$ and $I_{x2}$ the currents in the coils around the $x$ axis, $B_x$ is\ncontrolled by $(I_{x1}+I_{x2})$ and $\\partial B_x/\\partial x $ is\ncontrolled by $(I_{x1}-I_{x2})$ (similarly for the y direction). If\nonly $B_x$ and $B_y$ are to be compensated, so that only $B_z$\ninhomogeneities are relevant a simpler control can be made with\nthree currents only, using pure Helmholtz configuration in $x$ and $y$\ndirections ($(I_{x1}=I_{x2})$, $(I_{y1}=I_{y2})$), and pure anti-Helmholtz \n$(I_{z1}=-I_{z2})$ configuration in the $z$ direction. In our present \nset-up, we opted for this latter, simpler choice.\n\n\nThe three independent off-diagonal elements of the gradient ($\\partial \nB_y/\\partial x$, $\\partial B_z/\\partial x$, $\\partial B_z/\\partial y$) can \nbe controlled with couples of magnetic dipoles symmetrically located far \naway from the sensor in order to produce a vanishing, quadrupole field in \nthe region of the cell. Again, provided that $\\partial B_y/\\partial x$ \nproduces negligible effects because not responsible for $B_z$ \ninhomogeneities, only two of these three couples needs to be\neffectively  adjusted. We actually use dipoles oriented in $z$\ndirection and  located in the $xy$ plane. As the dipole  field gradient \ndecreases with the fourth power of the distance, fixing the dipoles on the\nframe of the large Helmholtz coils  would make necessary to use pretty\nlarge current and pretty heavy coils. We  simplified our task by using\nseveral couples of Nd permanent magnets in order  to coarsely compensate\nthe off-diagonal gradient components, and smaller  electromagnets with\nfew hundreds mA current for fine adjustments. \n\n\n\\acknowledgments\nThe authors thank R.\\ Mariotti and  M.\\ Focardi for very useful discussions. \nS.

The mechanical behavior of many real\nfluids, especially those of low molecular weight, appears to be\naccurately described by these equations over a wide range of\ncircumstances. There are, however, many real substances which are\ncapable of flowing but which are not at all well described by the\nNavier-Stokes theory. Due to this reason many fluid models have been\nproposed and studied by different authors. Among these, the fluids\nof differential type have received much attention. Interesting\nstudies of differential type fluids are given by Rajagopal\n\\cite{Rajagopal1}, Erdogan \\cite{Erdogan}, Rajagopal and Gupta\n\\cite{Gupta}, Bandelli \\cite{Bandelli1}, Siddiqui and Kaloni\n\\cite{Siddiqui0}, Benharbit and Siddiqui \\cite{Siddiqui1}, Ariel\n\\cite{Ariel0, Ariel1}, Fetecau and Fetecau \\cite{Fetecau} and Hayat\net al. \\cite{Hayat3, Hayat4, Hayat5}. The fluids of third grade,\nwhich form a subclass of the fluids of differential type, have been\nsuccessfully studied in various types of motions.\n\nMoro et al. \\cite{Moro} determined some exact solutions of the\nequations governing the steady plane motion of an incompressible\nthird grade fluid employing hodograph and Legendre transformations.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present some exact solutions for steady\nplane motions of incompressible third grade fluids. For this, the\ncomplex variables and complex functions are used. Some previous\nsolutions can be obtained as special cases of our solutions. In\nsections 2 and 3 are presented the constitutive equations and the\nexpression of the vorticity function $\\omega.$ Section 4 contains\nsolutions and their graphical illustrations.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:level2}Constitutive and governing equations}\n\nThe fluids of grade $n,$ introduced by Rivlin and Ericksen\n\\cite{Rivlin}, are the fluids for which the stress tensor is a\npolynomial of degree $n$ in the first $n$ Rivlin-Ericksen tensors\ndefined recursively by \\bea \\nonumber &&A_1 = (\\partial_i u_j\n+\\partial_j u_i)_{i,\\, j}\\,;\\\\&& A_n = \\frac{d}{dt}A_{n-1} + A_{n-1}\nL + L^t A_{n-1}\\,, \\,\\,\\, n > 1 \\eea where $\\frac{d}{dt}=\\partial_t + u\n\\cdot\\nabla$ denotes the material derivative and\n\\begin{equation}\nL=(\\partial_j u_i)_{i,\\,j} \\, \\, ; \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, L^t=(\\partial_i\nu_j)_{i,\\,j} \\, .\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nPhysical considerations were taken into account by Fosdick and\nRajagopal \\cite{Fosdic} in order to obtain the following form of\nconstitutive equation for the Cauchy stress $T$ in a third grade\nfluid: \\bea\\nonumber &&T = -pI + \\mu\nA_1+\\alpha_1A_2+\\alpha_2A^2_1+\\beta_1 A_3+\\\\&&+\n\\beta_2[A_1A_2+A_2A_1]+\\beta_3(tr A^2_1)A_1 \\eea where $-pI$ is the\nspherical stress due to the constraint of incompressibility, $\\mu$\nis the dynamic viscosity, $\\alpha_i(i=1,2)$ and $\\beta_i(i=1,2,3)$\nare the material constants and the three\nRivlin-Ericksen tensors $A_1, A_2$ and $A_3$ are given in equation (1).\\\\\nFurthermore, a complete thermodynamic analysis of the constitutive\nequation (2) has been given by Fosdick and Rajagopal \\cite{Fosdic}.\nThe Clausius--Duhem inequality and the assumption that the Helmholtz\nfree energy is a minimum in equilibrium provide the following\nrestrictions, \\bea\\nonumber &&\\mu \\geq 0\\, ,\\,\\,\\,\\alpha_1 \\geq 0\\,\n,\\,\\,\\,|\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2| \\leq \\sqrt{24 \\mu \\beta_3}\\,,\\\\&&\n\\beta_1=\\beta_2=0\\, ,\\,\\,\\,\\beta_3 \\geq 0\\,. \\eea Thus equation (2)\nbecomes\n\\begin{equation}\nT=-pI+\\alpha_1 A_2 + \\alpha_2 A^2_1 +[\\mu +\\beta_3(tr A^2_1)]A_1\\, ,\n\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mu_{eff}= \\mu + \\beta_3(trA^2_1)$ is the effective\nshear-dependent viscosity.\\\\\nThe velocity field corresponding to the motion is given as:\n$$v=v(x,y)=(u(x,y), v(x,y), 0)\\,.$$\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:level3}Flow equations}\n\nThe basic equations governing the steady plane motion of a\nhomogeneous incompressible fluid of third grade, in the absence of\nbody forces are \\cite{Moro} \\bea \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} +\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}= 0 \\eea \\bea\\nonumber&& \\frac{\\partial\nh}{\\partial x}=\\rho v \\omega - \\mu\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial\ny}- \\alpha_{1}v \\nabla^{2}\\omega - \\beta_{3}\\frac{\\partial (\\omega\nM)}{\\partial y}+\\\\&&+ 2\\beta_{3}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\nx}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\nx}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y}) \\eea \\bea\\nonumber&& \\frac{\\partial\nh}{\\partial y}=-\\rho u \\omega+\\mu\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial\nx}+\\alpha_{1}u \\nabla^{2}\\omega+\\beta_{3}\\frac{\\partial (\\omega\nM)}{\\partial x}+\\\\&&+ 2\\beta_{3}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\ny}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y}) \\eea where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\omega = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nh=\\frac{\\rho q^{2}}{2}-\\alpha_{1}(u \\nabla^{2}u+v\\nabla^{2}v)-(3\n\\alpha_{1}+2\\alpha_{2})\\frac{M}{4}+p\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nM=4(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})^{2}+4(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\ny})^{2}+2(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} +\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny})^{2}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nq^{2}=u^{2}+v^{2}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nEquations (5) and (6) are non-linear partial differential equations\nfor three unknowns $u,\\,v$   and $\\rho$  as functions of $x$ and\n$y$.

this paper, we reconsidered the flow equations of Moro et al.\n\\cite{Moro} with the objective of determining some exact solutions.\n\nFor this purpose the vorticity function $\\omega$  and the stream\nfunction $\\psi$  are expressed in terms of complex variables and\ncomplex function. The condition which the complex functions must\nsatisfy is determined through the equations for the generalized\nenergy function $h$  by using the compatibility condition\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x\n\\partial y}= \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y \\partial x}$.\n\nSome exact solutions to the flow equations are determined using the\ncondition for the complex functions. The solutions presented in this\npaper admit, as particular cases, all the solutions of Moro et al.\n\\cite{Moro} by appropriately choosing the complex functions or the\narbitrary constants therein.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nI wish to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and\nsuggestions, which significantly improved the paper.\n\nI am also thankful to Prof. C.

However, besides strong electronic correlations, the topology of the underlying lattice structure itself\nconstitutes another important ingredient that can produce exotic electronic ground states.\n\nThe CoO$_2$-layers in the \\NCOx\\/ materials, which are built up from edge-sharing CoO$_6$ octahedra, constitute a realization of a correlated\nelectron system based on a triangular lattice. More specifically, these compounds possess a layered hexagonal structure, where strongly covalent\nCoO$_2$- and ionic Na-layers ($ab$-planes) alternate along the perpendicular $c$-axis \\cite{HuangPRB04a}. Upon changing the Na content $x$, these\nmaterials can be doped with electrons and, in addition, water molecules can be intercalated. Both changing $x$ and water intercalation drastically\nalter the electronic properties of \\NCOx, leading most notably to the emergence of superconductivity upon hydration \\cite{FooPRL04,TakadaNature03}.\n%\nWe will focus on the non-hydrated compounds with $x\\simeq0.7$, where an anomalous metallic state with an extremely large and field dependent\nthermoelectric power as well as a giant field dependent scattering rate was observed \\cite{WangNature03,LiPRL04}. There is also evidence for the\nseemingly paradoxical coexistence of electron itinerancy and localized magnetic moments, as well as for unusual charge order CDW phenomena in these\nmacroscopically metallic compounds \\cite{GavilanoPRB04,BernhardPRL04,NingPRL04}.\n\n\n%\n%The electronic properties described above can hardly be reconciled by any conventional band theory and, indeed, there is evidence for unusual spin,\n%charge and orbital correlations in \\NCOx \\/ \\cite{KhaliullinPRL04,DaghoferPreprint06}.\nThe unconventional electronic properties described above strongly motivate the study of the electronic structure of \\NCOx\\/ by means of angular\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which provides direct and unique experimental access to single-particle excitations and, thus, to the\nmany-body effects in these materials. Previous ARPES studies on \\NCOx\\/ \\cite{VallaNature02,YangPRL04,HasanPRL04,YangPRL05,QianPRL06,QianPRL06b}\nshowed pronounced deviations from the electronic structure predicted by LDA\ncalculations \\cite{SinghPRB00}. %Most notably the hole-pockets along the \\GK-direction predicted by LDA for $x<0.6$ were found to sink below the Fermi\n%energy $E_F$ \\cite{YangPRL05}.\nIn addition, a strongly renormalized heavy QP band, displaying a  kink feature was reported \\cite{YangPRL04,HasanPRL04,YangPRL05}.\n\n\n\nIn this ARPES study we focus on the momentum ($k$) dependent renormalization effects in \\NCO , which is\nessential to unravel the relevant couplings that govern the low energy physics. % and, hence, the electronic properties of this material.\n%\n%Sect. 2: Experiment\nARPES experiments were carried out using a lab-based system equipped with a SCIENTA SES 200 analyser and a Gammadata He discharge lamp at an\nexcitation energy $h \\nu = 21.2$\\,eV (energy resolution 30\\,meV, angular resolution 0.3$^{\\circ}$).\n%In addition, measurements at different excitation energies between 50\\,eV and 90\\,eV were carried out\n%using radiation from the U125/1-PGM beamline at the BESSY Synchrotron Radiation Facility and a SCIENTA SES 100 analyzer.\nThe high-quality \\NCO\\/ single crystals examined in this study were grown by the sodium chloride flux methods as described in Ref.\\,\\cite{Iljev04}.\n\n% Sect. 3: Lab-Results\n\n% Sect. 3.1: FL-Crossing\n\nA typical Fermi level ($E_F$) crossing observed at T=25\\,K is shown in Fig.\\,1, where the image on the left hand side shows the photoelectron\nintensity as a function of momentum $k$ and binding energy $E_B$. A single and well defined QP band, which crosses the Fermi energy at $E_B=0$\\,eV\ncan be observed. On the right hand side of Fig.\\,1 an energy distribution curve (EDC) and a momentum distribution curve (MDC)\nare shown. % demonstrating the very good quality of the obtained data.\n%\n%Sect. 3.2: Map data\nBy mapping the $E_F$ crossings over a large area of $k$-space, a cut through the Fermi surface (FS) of \\NCO\\/ parallel to the CoO$_2$ planes was\nmeasured. The data allows for a precise calibration of the $k$-scale, because dispersions from the first into the second Brillouin zone were\ncaptured. In Figs.\\,2\\,(a),(b) the $k$-dependent photoelectron intensity for two fixed binding energies of $E_B=0$\\,eV and 0.132\\,eV are shown.\n%\nFocussing on the cut at $E_B=0$\\,eV in Fig.\\,2\\,(a), a large hole-pocket centered around the Brillouin zone center $\\Gamma$ is observed. The FS\ndisplays a clear hexagonal topology. The intensity variations along the FS, leading to a seemingly lower symmetry, are caused by matrix element\neffects.\n%\nThe size of the observed FS agrees well with the doping level, provided that only one of the two $a_{1g}$-bands (cf. Fig.\\,2\\,(c)) crosses $E_F$.\nThis agrees with the data shown in Fig.\\,1, where a single QP-band crosses $E_F$ .\n\n%Note also that the sharp features at $E_F$ are indicative of a two-dimensional (2D) system, because a strong broadening would be expected for a\n%three-dimensional (3D) system (see discussion below) \\cite{StarnbergPRB93}.\n%\n\nIn accordance with previous studies, the hole-pockets along \\GK\\/ are not observed for $E_B=0$\\,eV.  It can be seen in Fig.\\,2\\,(b) that the\ncorresponding $e_g'$-band (cf. Fig.\\,2\\,(c)) lies well below $E_F$, as reported earlier \\cite{YangPRL05}.\n%\nThis can also be observed in Fig.\\,2\\,(c), where the measured band structure along \\GK \\/ and \\GM \\/ is compared to the band structure obtained by\nLDA \\cite{SinghPRB00}. There is a fair agreement of the ARPES data and LDA at higher binding energies above 1.5\\,eV. However, close to $E_F$\ndeviations occur which are particularly pronounced along \\GK.\n%\n\n\nIn Fig.\\,3 two cuts of the data set shown in Fig.\\,2 along the \\GK- (left) and \\GM-direction (right) are shown.\n%\nFocussing on the cut along  \\GK , two prominent features can be observed. First, there is a band crossing $E_F$ that forms the FS. Second, there is\nanother band at higher binding energies, which can be identified as the $e_g'$-band. The data indicates that the top of the $e_g'$-band is at about\n85\\,meV.\n\nBy tracking the maximum of the MDCs for different $E_B$, the QP-dispersion ($E(k)$) indicated by black symbols is obtained. Close to $E_F$ the\ndispersion can be well described by a linear behavior, yielding the Fermi velocity  $v_F=(0.3\\pm0.05)$\\,eV\\,\\AA \\/ along \\GK .\n%\nHowever, at slightly higher $E_B$, the measured dispersion is bent and thus deviates from the linear behavior close to $E_F$.\n%\nWe define the energy where this deviation becomes significant as $E_d$, resulting in $E_d=(26\\pm 8)$\\,meV for the \\GK-direction. The second bend in\nthe dispersion around 80\\,meV is related to the crossing of the two bands \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n%Turning to the cut along the \\GM-direction, a kink of the QP-band can also be observed.\nApplying the same analysis to the cut along \\GM\\/ leads to $v_F=(0.6\\pm0.08)$\\,eV\\,\\AA\\/ and $E_d=(66 \\pm 5)$\\,meV. Clearly, both $v_F$ and $E_d$\ndepend on the direction in $k$-space.\n\nThe observed bending of the dispersion that sets in around $E_d$ could be due to a coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations. In fact, consistent\nwith this interpretation, we observe an enhanced increase of the scattering rate around $E_d$.\n%\nIt has to be noted, however, that the feature in the dispersion observed here is not as well defined as the kink in the cuprates, for example. This\nmeans that  the values of $E_d$ cannot be identified straightforwardly with a specific mode energy and, moreover, a coupling to several different\nbosonic excitations is possible.\n\n\n%Sect. 3.4.: Anisotropic Renormalization:\nIn the following we will focus on $v_F$, which is a well defined quantity: Cuts for different $\\psi$-values (cf. Fig.\\,1\\,(b)) were systematically\nanalyzed in the same way as described above. The obtained variation of $v_F$ as determined from the ARPES data is shown in Fig.\\,4\\,(a). Upon\nrotating the direction of the cut from \\GM\\/ to \\GK\\/, $v_F$ decreases by about a factor of 2.\n%and the values for $v_F$ as well as $E_k$ are almost perfectly symmetric with respect to the \\GK-direction at $\\psi=210^{\\circ}$.\nUsing the function $k_F(\\psi)$ that was determined from the data in Fig.\\,2\\,(a) together with the obtained values of $v_F$, the variation of the\neffective mass $m^*$ with $\\psi$ can be calculated. The result is given in Fig.\\,4\\,(c). Remarkably, the QP along the \\GK\\/ direction is about twice\nas heavy as the QP along \\GM. This pronounced anisotropy of $m^*$ is expected to have a strong impact on the in-plane electronic properties of \\NCO.\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the renormalization effects in \\NCO, we use the LDA band structure as a reference and compare the ARPES Fermi velocities ($v_F^{PES}$)\nto the corresponding LDA values ($v_F^{LDA}$). As it can be observed in Figs.\\,4\\,(a),(b), these two quantities show exactly the opposite behavior:\n$v_F^{PES}$ decreases and $v_F^{LDA}$ increases upon rotation from \\GM\\/ to \\GK.\n%\nIn order to check whether the deviation between ARPES and LDA is related to a lattice distortion at the surface, LDA calculations were performed for\nstructures where the distance between the oxygen and the cobalt layers, i.e. the Co--O--Co bond angle, was changed. In agreement with previous\ncalculations, we observe that the top of the $e_g'$ band is shifted to higher binding energies upon increasing the Co--O--Co bond angle. At the same\ntime the anisotropy of $v_F^{\\rm LDA}$ is slightly reduced, but unchanged qualitatively. This strongly suggests  that the measured anisotropy of\n$v_F^{PES}$ is not caused by a lattice distortion at the surface.\n\n\n The comparison of LDA and ARPES therefore shows that the deviation of the LDA\nbandstructure from the measured QP-dispersion increases dramatically close to the \\GK-direction (cf. inset of Fig.\\,3). In the following we will\nrefer to this deviation as QP-renormalization (QPR).\n%\nThis QPR can be characterized using a constant $\\kappa$ defined by $(1+\\kappa)\\,v_F^{PES}=v_F^{LDA}$. The $\\psi$- or, in other words, k-dependence of\n$\\kappa$ is shown in Fig.\\,4\\,(d), revealing the strong anisotropy of the QPR in \\NCO. We note that, although the photoelectron intensity in\nFig.\\,2\\,(a) at $k_F$ is also influenced by matrix element effects, it is always significantly lower in the \\GK- than in the \\GM-direction, in\nagreement with enhanced renormalization effects along \\GK.\n\n\n\n\nWe find $\\partial_k E^{PES}\\simeq \\partial_k E^{LDA}/2$ along \\GK \\/ in the whole energy range up to $E_B=85$\\,meV (inset of Fig.\\,3).\n%even in the energy range well below $E_d\\simeq\n%26$\\,meV (cf. inset of Fig.\\,3). %i.e. the QP-dispersion is not affected by the coupling to a single bosonic mode alone.\n%\nAt the same time it is remarkable that the QPR gets stronger the closer the so-called $e_g'$-band gets to the Fermi level (c.f. Fig.2\\,(b)). This\npoints to an effect related to coupling between the $a_{1g}$- and the $e_g'$-bands. In fact, a strong interaction between these bands is manifested\nby a large hybridization gap at higher binding energies  and the polarization dependence along \\GK\\/ found in a recent ARPES study \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n%\nHence, the $k$-dependent QPR at $E_F$ is most likely caused by multiorbital effects, i.e. interactions between the states of $e_g'$ and $a_{1g}$\nsymmetry. In this case, the QP-states along \\GM\\/ and \\GK\\/ display different properties: Along \\GM\\/ the QP-states have largely $a_{1g}$ symmetry,\nwhile they display pronounced multiorbital properties along \\GK . This is of crucial importance for the many-body effects in these materials, since\nthe coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations depends critically on the symmetry of the QP-states \\cite{DevereauxPRL04}.\n%\n%Since the coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations depends critically on the symmetry of the QP-states \\cite{DevereauxPRL04}, this might be related\n%to the $k$-dependence of $E_d$ described above.\nTo conclude so far, the observed anisotropies clearly indicate that multiorbital effects play an important role for the QP-dynamics at $E_F$.\n\n\n\n%%% DFT cannot describe vF(psi)\n\nFurthermore, our DFT studies --details will be provided in a forthcoming publication-- show that %, besides the multi-orbital effects,\nmagnetic correlations play an important role for the QP-dynamics as well: According to non-magnetic LDA calculations the band structure of \\NCOc\\/\ndisplays a strong 3D character. In agreement with a previous DFT study \\cite{JohannesEPL04}, we obtain a sizeable $k_z$-dispersion parallel to the\n$c$-axis that leads to additional caps of the FS as shown in Figs.\\,5\\,(a),(b). Such a strong 3D character is not in agreement with ARPES data: (i)\nin general, the QP peaks at $E_F$ are expected to be considerably broadened in a 3D system, in particular because the short life time of the final\nstates becomes important \\cite{StarnbergPRB93}. This is not the case (Fig.\\,1). (ii) ARPES measurements at various excitation energies do not show\nany evidence for a strong dispersion along $c$ \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n\nHowever, magnetic LSDA calculations yield an AFM ground state, where ferromagnetic $ab$-planes are coupled antiferromagnetically along $c$. This\nagrees well with neutron data \\cite{HelmePRL05}. In the AFM state, the $k_z$-dispersion is strongly reduced, which removes the aforementioned FS-caps\nand yields the FS shown in Fig.\\,5\\,(c). In other words, according to LSDA, 3D AFM correlations\n%at low temperatures\nrender the electronic structure of \\NCOc\\/ effectively 2D. The top of the $e_g'$-band at $E_B\\simeq 70$\\,meV as well as the topology and size of the\nFS obtained in LSDA are in good agreement with the ARPES data as demonstrated in 5\\,(d). The above results together with the neutron data indicate\nthat AFM correlations have a strong influence on the electronic structure of \\NCOx\\/ with $x\\simeq0.75$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the QPR in \\NCO \\/ is strongly anisotropic and provided clear evidence for the relevance of multiorbital effects\nfor the QP dynamics in this material. In addition, detailed DFT studies highlight the impact of magnetic correlations on the QP-states near $E_F$,\nwhich is expected to be directly related to the unusual temperature as well as the field dependencies of the thermopower and the QP scattering rates\n\\cite{WangNature03,LiPRL04,HasanPRL04}.

Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on\n  an approach we have recently developed and tested in simulations of isolated\n  galaxy mergers. Here we apply the same model in cosmological simulations to\n  examine: (i) the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly in\n  galaxies, (ii) the evolution of the local black hole-host mass correlations\n  and (iii) the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars,\n  as well\n  as the properties of their hosts and descendants today. We find that our\n  simulations produce a total black hole mass density $\\rho_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 2\n  \\times 10^{5} \\Msun\\Mpc^{-3}$ by $z=0$, \n  in good agreement with observational\n  estimates. The black hole accretion rate density, $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm BH}$,\n  peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the\n  star formation rate density, $\\dot{\\rho}_{*}$, with an approximate scaling\n  as $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm BH}/\\dot{\\rho}_{*} \\propto (1+z)^{-4}$ at $z\\ge3$. On\n  the other hand, the ratio $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*} \\sim (1+z)^{-0.6}$ of\n  black hole to stellar mass densities shows only a moderate evolution at low\n  redshifts $z \\lesssim 3$. For the population of galaxies identified in the\n  simulations at $z=1$ we find strong correlations between black hole mass and\n  velocity dispersion or mass of the stellar systems. The predicted\n  correlations agree well with the measured local $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ and\n  $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relationships, but also suggest a weak evolution with\n  redshift in the normalization, and in particular the slope. However, the\n  magnitude of this effect is sensitive to the range of masses being probed.\n  For\n  stellar masses of $M_{*}\\ge 3\\times 10^{10}$, we predict a trend of\n  increasing $M_{*}/ M_{\\rm BH}$ with redshift, in agreement with recent\n  direct estimates of the BH to host stellar mass ratio at high redshift and\n  the conjecture that a more fundamental relation (a BH fundamental plane)\n  should involve both $M_{*}$ and $\\sigma$.  We find that our simulation\n  models can also produce quite massive black holes at high redshift, as a\n  result of extended periods of exponential growth in relatively isolated,\n  rare regions that collapse early and exhibit strong gas\n  inflows. Interestingly, when followed to their descendants, these first\n  supermassive BH systems are not necessarily the most massive ones today,\n  since they are often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{quasars: general --- galaxies: formation --- galaxies: active --- \ngalaxies: evolution --- cosmology: theory --- hydrodynamics}\n\n\\section{Introduction\\label{sec:intro}}\nFollowing the discovery of quasars \\citep{Schmidt1963, Greenstein1963} it was\nsuggested that supermassive black holes ($10^6-10^9$~\\Msun) lie at the centers\nof galaxies, and that the quasar activity is fueled by the release of\ngravitational energy from their accreted matter. The remnants of quasar phases\nat early times are probably the supermassive black holes found at the centers\nof galaxies in our local Universe. Interestingly, the properties of these\nsupermassive black holes are tightly coupled to the mass \\citep{Magorrian1998}\nand velocity dispersion of their host galaxies, as manifested in the $M_{\\rm\n  BH}-\\sigma$ relation of spheroids \\citep{Ferrarese2000, Gebhardt2000}. In\naddition, the black hole mass is correlated with the concentration or Sersic\nindex \\citep{Graham2006}.  Most recently, \\citet{Hopkins2007a} have shown \nthat these various correlations are not independent, and can be\nunderstood as projections of a ``black hole fundamental plane'' (BHFP),\nsimilar to that describing properties of elliptical galaxies.\n\nThe existence of highly luminous quasars also\nconstrains the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and the epoch of\nreionization. Quasars with inferred black hole masses in excess of\n$10^9$~\\Msun\\ have now been discovered out to $z\\sim 6$ \\citep{Fan2003},\nindicating an early formation time for black holes and galaxy spheroids and\nposing a significant challenge for theoretical models of high-redshift quasar\nand galaxy formation.\n\nThis growing observational evidence, drawn from local galaxies to high\nredshift quasars, argues for a close connection between the formation and\nevolution of galaxies and of their central supermassive black holes. However,\nthe physical nature of this relationship has yet to be understood in detail.\nIndeed, there are significant gaps in our observational and theoretical\nknowledge of the history of black hole formation and evolution in galaxies.\n\nFor example, current velocity dispersion measurements are inconclusive about\nthe important question whether the tight scaling relations evolve with\nredshift \\citep{Woo2006,Shields2006}, or are essentially invariant\n\\citep{Shields2003} as a function of time. We note that some\nevolution in the ratio of black hole to halo mass\nis suggested by clustering constraints \\citep[e.g][]{Adelberger2005,\nLidz2006}, but these measurements do not directly address\nthe relationship between black hole and properties of the\nluminous host galaxy.  More relevant are \ncomparisons of the black hole mass inferred from quasar observations\nto the host stellar mass, both observationally\n\\citep{Merloni2004} and theoretically \\citep{Hopkins2006a},\nwhich indicate an evolution in e.g. the Magorrian relation, in\nthe sense that black holes are more massive relative to luminous\nspheroids at high redshifts than at $z=0$.  \n\nTheoretical studies of the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies have so\nfar mostly used so-called semi-analytical modeling\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Kauffmann2000, Cattaneo1999, Wyithe2003a, Volonteri2003,\nDiMatteo2003, Granato2004, Springel2005c, Cattaneo2005, Croton2006,\nDeLucia2006, Malbon2007} of galaxy formation, in which the growth of\ngalaxies and their embedded black holes is followed with simple physical\nparameterizations on top of dark matter merging history trees. Many of these\nmodels assume that quasar activity is triggered by major galaxy mergers,\nmotivated by hydrodynamical simulations that have shown that gravitational\ntidal fields during major mergers of gas rich galaxies produce strong gas\ninflows \\citep{BarnesHernquist1991, BarnesHernquist1996}, which lead to a\nburst of nuclear star formation \\citep{Mihos1996} and are likely the\nprerequisite for rapid black hole growth and quasar activity.  Nearby quasars\nare indeed preferentially found in tidally disturbed objects\n\\citep[e.g][]{Jogee2004}, corroborating the importance of galaxy interactions\nand mergers for major black hole growth.\n\nMany theoretical explanations for the observed correlations between galaxy\nproperties and black hole mass rely on some form of self-regulated growth of\nthe BHs. For example, it has been suggested that the central black holes grow\nuntil they release sufficient energy to unbind the gas that feeds them from\ntheir host galaxy \\citep{CiottiOstriker1997, Silk1998, Fabian1999,\nWyithe2003a}. We recently explored such a local energy feedback for the first\ntime with self-consistent, fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxies \\citep{DiMatteo2005,Springel2005a} that include a treatment of\naccretion on supermassive black holes and their associated energy\nfeedback. These simulations have demonstrated that the fundamental BH-host\ncorrelation including the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation can indeed be\nreproduced in feedback-regulated models of BH growth \\citep{DiMatteo2005}, in\naccordance with theoretical conjectures. At the same time, the dynamical\ncoupling in the simulations of hydrodynamical gas inflow, star formation,\nblack hole growth and associated feedback processes gives them substantial\npredictive power well beyond that of simplified analytical and semi-analytical\nmodels. Besides the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ or $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Robertson2006a} relationships, the simulation models can\nfor example predict the detailed properties of the spheroidal galaxies forming\nin major mergers and how they correlate with the BH masses. In fact, they\nsuggest the existence of a fundamental plane relation for BHs ($M_{BH} \\propto\n\\sigma^{3.0} R_e^{0.5}$ \\citep{Hopkins2007a}, provide an explanation for the\nred colors of massive elliptical galaxies \\citep{Springel2005b}, and\ndescribe the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies \\citep{Robertson2006b}.\nThey also suggest luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes, leading to a new\ninterpretation for the origin of the quasar luminosity function and its\nevolution over cosmic history~\\citep{Hopkins2005, Hopkins2006a}.\n\nIn the present paper, we extend these earlier studies by carrying out fully\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the $\\Lambda$CDM model that jointly\nfollow the growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes, as well as their\nassociated feedback processes. Our approach is based on the same methodology\nthat we have developed and applied in the high-resolution simulations of\ngalaxy mergers, augmented with a suitable mechanism to seed emerging new dark\nmatter halos with a small black hole that can then grow by gas accretion later\non. While much more restricted in numerical resolution than simulations of\nindividual galaxy mergers, our modeling of star formation and black hole\nphysics in terms of a sub-resolution treatment provides quite accurate results\nalready at comparatively coarse resolution, an important prerequisite for\nattempting to model these processes in cosmological simulations. Nevertheless,\nnumerical resolution is clearly an important limitation of our cosmological\nresults, an aspect that we will discuss in more detail where appropriate. With\nthis caveat in mind, we would like to stress however that the unambiguous\ninitial conditions of direct cosmological simulation make them in principle\nthe most powerful and accurate tool for studying the interplay of galaxy\nformation and black hole growth.  Our aim is therefore to examine how well our\ncurrent model for treating BH physics in simulations does in present\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations of cosmic structure formation,\nand what we can learn from them to advance our theoretical understanding of\nthe co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. In this study we\nshall focus on basic properties of the black hole population, like the\nevolution of the cosmic BH mass density, and the correlations between BH\nmasses and host galaxy properties. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we also study an\nextension of our feedback model with a `radio mode' that is active at low\naccretion rates and is distinct from the normal quasar activity, allowing us\nto study the formation of AGN in rich galaxy clusters at low redshifts, where\nit is likely to be important.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows.  In \\S2 we describe our simulation set\nand the numerical modeling adopted for the ISM, star formation and gas\naccretion onto black holes. In \\S3 we present our results for the evolution of\nthe global black hole mass density and compare it to the cosmic history of\nstar formation and the evolution of the stellar density.  In \\S4 we examine our\nresults for the fundamental BH/host correlations measured from the simulation\nand for their evolution from high to low redshift. Finally, we summarize and\ndiscuss our findings in \\S5.\n\n\\section{Methodology\\label{sec:method}}\n\n\\subsection{Numerical code}\nIn this study we focus on a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with parameters\nchosen according to the first year results from the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe \\citep[WMAP1;][] {Spergel2003}, $\\Omega_0 = 0.3$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.7$, Hubble constant $H_0 = 100 h \\kmpspMpc$ with $h\n=0.7$ and a scale invariant primordial power spectrum with index $n=1$, with a\nnormalization of the amplitude of fluctuations $\\sigma_{8} = 0.9$.\n\\footnote{The largest simulation presented here had already been started by\n  the time the updated third year constraints have become available\n  \\citep[WMAP3;][]{Spergel2006}. We comment on effects on the growth of the\n  halo mass function owing to the lower amplitude of fluctuations, $\\sigma_{8}$\n  implied by WMAP3 in ~\\citet{Li2007, Sijacki2007}}. We use a significantly\n  extended version of the parallel cosmological TreePM-SPH code {\\small\n  GADGET2}~\\citep{Springel2005d} to evolve a realization of $\\Lambda$CDM\n  initial conditions from high to low redshift. The combination of a\n  high-resolution gravitational solver with individual and adaptive timesteps\n  allows this code to bridge a large dynamic range both in length- and\n  timescales.  Gas dynamics is followed with the Lagrangian smoothed particle\n  hydrodynamics (SPH)~\\citep[e.g] []{Monaghan1992} technique, which we employ\n  in a formulation that manifestly conserves energy and entropy, despite the\n  use of fully adaptive SPH smoothing lengths~\\citep{Springel2002}.  Radiative\n  cooling and heating processes are computed as in \\citet{Katz1996}, with a\n  spatially uniform photoionizing UV background that is imposed externally.\n\nWithin cosmological (or galaxy-sized) numerical simulations, it is presently\n(and for some time to come) not feasible to follow the physics of star\nformation and black hole accretion from first principles down to scales of\nindividual stars or black holes.  Any numerical model of galaxy formation\ntherefore needs to make substantial approximations for some of the relevant\nphysics on unresolved scales.\n\n\nFor modeling star formation and its associated supernova feedback we use the\nsub-resolution multiphase model for the interstellar medium developed by\n\\citet{Springel2003a}. In this model, a thermal instability is assumed to\noperate above a critical density threshold $\\rho_{\\rm th}$, producing a two\nphase medium consisting of cold clouds embedded in a tenuous gas at pressure\nequilibrium. Stars form from the cold clouds, and short-lived stars supply an\nenergy of $10^{51}\\,{\\rm ergs}$ to the surrounding gas as supernovae. This\nenergy heats the diffuse phase of the ISM and evaporates cold clouds, thereby\nestablishing a self-regulation cycle for star formation.  $\\rho_{\\rm th}$ is\ndetermined self-consistently in the model by requiring that the equation of\nstate (EOS) is continuous at the onset of star formation. The cloud\nevaporation process and the cooling function of the gas then determine the\ntemperatures and the mass fractions of the two hot and cold phases of the\nISM, such that the EOS of the model can be directly computed as a function of\ndensity. The latter is encapsulating the self-regulated nature of star\nformation owing to supernovae feedback in a simple model for a multiphase ISM.\nAs in the \\citet{Springel2003a} model we have included a model\nfor supernova-driven galactic winds with an initial wind speed of $v \\sim 480\n\\kmps$.\n\nFor the parameter settings adopted here, the model reproduces the observed\nstar formation rate surface densities in isolated spiral\ngalaxies~\\citep{Kennicutt1989, Kennicutt1998}. Using a large number of nested\ncosmological simulations, the approach we adopt (and the parameters we use)\nhas also been shown to lead to a numerically converged estimate\nfor the cosmic star formation history of the universe that agrees reasonably\nwell with low redshift observations \\citep{Springel2003b,Hernquist2003}.\nFor the modeling\nof BH accretion and feedback we adopt a similar strategy as for star\nformation, which we discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Accretion and Feedback from Supermassive black holes}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1a.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1b.ps}}\\\\\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1c.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1d.ps}}\\\\\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1e.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1f.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Projected baryonic density field in slices of thickness\n$5000\\,h^{-1}\\kpc$ through our high resolution simulation, color-coded\nby temperature and with brightness proportional to the logarithm of\nthe gas density.

The circles mark the positions of\nthe black holes, with a size that encodes the BH mass, as indicated in\nthe top left panel.}\n\\label{fig:D6slices}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs for star formation, we adopt a sub-resolution model to capture the main\nfeatures of accretion and associated feedback on supermassive black holes\n\\citep[as introduced in][]{Springel2005a, DiMatteo2005}.  To this end, we\nrepresent black holes by collisionless `sink' particles that can grow in mass\nby accreting gas from their immediate environments, or by merging with other\nblack holes. We estimate the gas accretion rate onto a black hole using a\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton parameterization \\citep{Bondi1952, BondiHoyle1944,\nHoyle1939}. In this description, the accretion rate onto the black hole is\ngiven by $\\dot{M}_{\\rm B} \\, = \\, {{4\\pi \\, \\, [G^2 M_{\\rm BH}^2 \\, \\rho}] /\n{(c_s^2 + v^2)^{3/2}}} \\, $ where $\\rho$, $c_s$ are the density and sound\nspeed of the ISM gas, respectively, and $v$ is the velocity of the black hole\nrelative to the surrounding gas. In this study we also allow the black hole to\naccrete at mildly super-Eddington values and impose a maximum allowed\naccretion rate equal to $2x$ Eddington rate, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$. As we shall\nsee such conditions are generally achieved at high redshift.  We note that the\ndetailed relativistic accretion flow onto the black hole is {\\em unresolved}\nin our simulations, but if the limitating factor for rapid growth of BHs lies\nin the larger-scale gas distribution around the black hole, {\\em which is\nresolved}, then the Bondi prescription should capture the dependence of the\nmean accretion rate onto the conditions of the gas in the region around the\nblack hole.\n\nThe radiated luminosity, $L_{\\rm r}$ is related to the gas accretion rate,\n$\\dot {M}_{\\rm BH}$, by the radiative efficiency $ \\eta \\, = \\, {{L_{\\rm\nr}}/({\\dot {M}_{\\rm BH} \\, c^2}}) \\,$, which simply gives the mass to energy\nconversion efficiency, set by the amount of energy that can be extracted from\nthe innermost stable orbit of an accretion disk around a black hole. We will\nadopt a fixed value of $\\epsilon_{\\rm r} =0.1$, which is the mean value for a\nradiatively efficient \\citep{Shakura1973} accretion disk onto a Schwarzschild\nblack hole.\n\nWe assume that some small fraction $\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$ of the radiated\nluminosity $L_{\\rm r}$ can couple to the surrounding gas in the form of\nfeedback energy, viz. $ \\dot{E}_{\\rm feed} \\, = \\, \\epsilon_{\\rm f} \\, L_{\\rm\n  r}$\n% \\,\\, = \\, \\epsilon_{\\rm f} \\, 0.1 \\, \\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} \\,\n%c^2 \\, $. \nIn accordance with our previous studies of galaxy merger simulations we take\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm f} = 5 \\% $.  This value governs the normalization of the\n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation, and $\\epsilon_{\\rm f} = 5 \\% $ brings it into\nagreement with current observations \\citep{DiMatteo2005}. We note that\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$ is effectively the only free parameter in our black hole\nmodel. After fixing it to reproduce the normalization of the observed $M_{\\rm\n  BH} - \\sigma$ from the galaxy models we do not vary it in any of our\ncosmological simulations.\n\nFor simplicity, we deposit the feedback energy isotropically in the region\naround the black hole.  Lack of spatial resolution precludes us from\nconsidering mechanical modes of releasing the energy, e.g.~in the form of a\njet. However, we note that is is plausible that such other forms of energy are\nthermalized eventually as well, and that the final impact of the feedback\ndepends primarily on the total amount of energy released and less on the form\nit is released in.  This is likely to be true generally, provided that\nthe energy (or momentum) is imparted to the surrounding gas on length\nscales small and time scales short compared with those that characterize\nthe host galaxy.  In that event, the impact of black hole feedback will\nbe explosive in nature and, indeed, the blowout phase of evolution in\nour simulations is well-described by a generalized Sedov-Taylor\nblast-wave solution \\citep{Hopkins2006b,HH2006}.\nIn any case, we emphasize that despite an isotropic release of the energy,\nthe response of the gas can still be decidedly anisotropic, e.g.~when a dense\ngas disk is present that channels the gas response into a collimated outflow.\n\nThe idea that we follow with our feedback modeling here is the rapid\naccretion phases of BHs at times close to their critical growth phases. Such\n`quasar' phases are typically relatively short-lived and require galaxy\nmergers to produce the strong gravitational tidal forcing necessary for\nsufficient nuclear gas inflow rates. It is presently unclear whether the\naccretion disks in such modes actually produce mechanical jets of release\ntheir feedback in another way. It is however evident that at low redshift\n(e.g.; $z < 1$ which we are not studying directly here) that when BHs that are\nembedded in the hot gas atmospheres of large groups and clusters channel their\nenergy in mechanical feedback in the form of relativistic jets, generating\nbuoyantly rising radio bubble. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we consider this form\nof feedback mode.\n\n%This assumption is physically reasonable, and there is not likely\n%to be a feasible alternative at present.\n%Our understanding of the physics of accretion and how it couples to\n%jets/outflows from supermassive black holes is sufficiently poor that it\n%is not clear what range in spatial scales would be required to obtain\n%a complete description of the impact of black hole growth and feedback\n%on galactic scales. Even state-of-the-art 3-D numerical calculations\n%of individual accretion disks with magneto-rotational instability and\n%full-GR treatment \\citep{reference} currently need to be carried out\n%under quite restrictive assumptions (e.g., they are typically\n%non-radiative).\n\nAn important remaining question in our model concerns the ultimate origin of\nthe BHs. Since our accretion rate estimate can only grow a BH that already\nexists, we assume that a physical process that produces small seed BHs is\noperating sufficiently efficiently that effectively all halos above a certain\nthreshold mass contain at least one such seed BH. Whether or not they can then\ngrow to larger masses by gas accretion will be determined by the local gas\nconditions, as described in our model above. In order to achieve such a\nseeding at a technical level in cosmological runs we use an on-the-fly\n`friends-of-friends' group finder algorithm which is called at intervals\nequally spaced in the logarithm of the scale-factor $a$, with $\\Delta \\log{a} =\n\\log{1.25}$. This provides the locations and mass of all halos in the\nsimulation. If a halo is more massive than our threshold and does not contain\nany black hole yet, we endow it with one by converting its densest gas\nparticle into a sink particle with a seed black hole mass of $10^5\\, h^{-1}\n\\Msun$.  The further growth of the black hole sink can then proceed by gas\naccretion, at a rate that depends sensitively on the local conditions, or by\nmergers with other black hole sink particles.  The total cumulative black hole\nmass introduced in this way as seeds is negligible compared to the mass growth\nby gas accretion. We note that being able to run a fast, parallel\n`friends-of-friends' algorithm on the fly during simulations is an important\ntechnical prerequisite of our technique.\n\nFurther motivation for this choice of seeding procedure is based on the\ncurrently proposed scenarios for the seed black holes in galaxies. To grow a\nsupermassive black hole to a mass of $\\sim 10^{9} \\Msun$ in less than a\nbillion years, as required by presence of the $z=6$ SDSS quasars, may require\n(1) the catastrophic collapse of a supermassive star that forms a large\ninitial black hole of mass $10^4-10^6\\Msun$ \\citep{Carr1984, Bromm2003,\nBegelman2006}, or (2) alternatively, smaller black hole seeds ($M \\sim 10^2\n\\Msun$) may form from the first PopIII stars at $z \\sim 30$ and grow\nexponentially from then on \\citep{Abel2002, Bromm2004, Yoshida2006}.\nIn our simulations,\nblack hole seeds of mass $M=10^5 \\,h^{-1}\\Msun$ are introduced into galaxies\nas they initially reach $M_{\\rm halo} = 10^{10}\\,h^{-1} \\Msun$.  This choice\nis a good approximation to what is expected for both of the hypotheses\noutlined above.  For (1) this is roughly in the correct range; whereas for (2)\nEddington growth predicts that the black hole has grown to roughly these\nvalues by the time of collapse of $M \\sim 10^{10}h^{-1} \\Msun$ perturbations,\nwhich occurs at $z \\sim 10$ in our standard cold dark matter scenario.\nAdditionally, although not required, this value of the initial black hole mass\nto galaxy ratio fits the observed relations at low redshift\n\\citep{Magorrian1998, Ferrarese2000}. It is important to note that the\ndominant growth of black holes always occurs in exponential Eddington phases\ninduced by gas accretion so that our results are rather insensitive to the\nspecific choice of the seed mass.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Numerical parameters of cosmological simulations with BHs}\n\\label{tab:simul}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\nRun  &  Boxsize & $N_{p}$ & $m_{\\rm DM}$ & $m_{\\rm gas}$ & $\\epsilon$& $z_{\\rm en\nd}$ \\\\\n     &  $h^{-1}$Mpc &&  $h^{-1} \\Msun$ &$h^{-1} \\Msun$ &  $h^{-1}$ kpc &  \\\\\n\\hline\n  D4 & 33.75 & $2\\times 216^3$& $2.75 \\times 10^{8}$ & $4.24 \\times 10^{7}$  & 6.25\n& 0.00 \\\\\nD6 ({\\it BHCosmo}) & 33.75 & $2\\times 486^3$& $2.75\\times 10^{7}$ &  $4.24\\times 10^{6}$&\n2.73 & 1.00 \\\\\nE6 & 50 & $2\\times 486^3$& $7.85\\times 10^{7}$ &  $1.21\\times 10^{7}$&\n4.12 & 4.00 \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\nWhen galaxies and their surrounding dark halos merge to form a single dark\nmatter halo, their central black holes are also expected to merge eventually,\nso hierarchical black hole mergers contribute to the growth of the central\nblack holes.  Whether the forming black hole binaries can really coalesce\nefficiently is however a matter of debate.  In a stellar environment, it has\nbeen argued that the binary hardens only very slowly \\citep{Begelman1980,\nMilosav2003}, while in gaseous environments binaries may coalesce rapidly\nowing to strong dynamical friction with the gas \\citep{Makino2004,\nEscala2004}. In our galaxy-sized simulations, and even more so in the\ncosmological boxes, it is not possible to treat in detail the problem of\nbinary hardening, nor to directly calculate the ejection of black holes by\ngravitational recoil, or by three-body sling-shot ejection of black holes in\ntriple systems.  Because galaxies have typically large central concentrations\nof gas we instead assume that two black hole particles merge quickly if they\ncome within the spatial resolution of the simulation and their relative speed\nlies below the gas sound speed. In practice, this means that two sink\nparticles that fulfill these conditions are merged into a single BH particle,\nwith their masses combined.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{16.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f2.eps}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Three level zooms into the simulation region marked by the white\nrectangle in the $z=3$ panel of Fig~\\ref{fig:D6slices}.

This is\na substantial challenge, given that the brightest quasars at $z\\sim 6$ have a\nlow space density and are believed to reside in fairly massive dark matter\nhalos of mass $M\\sim 10^{11}-10^{12} \\Msun$, or even larger.  \nAt redshifts $z=2-3$, quasars\nhave a much larger space density, comparable to $L^{*}$ galaxies at $z=0$.\n\nThe strategy we choose here is model the universe with a periodic box of\nmoderate size $33.75\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ that is homogeneously sampled with\nparticles, and which we simulate with $2\\times 486^3$ particles, one of the\n{\\it highest resolutions} so far achieved in a full cosmological\nhydrodynamical calculation of galaxy formation. In this paper, we refer to\nthis largest simulation among our simulation set as the {\\it BHCosmo} run.  We\nwill also compare it with two additional simulations which differ in mass and\nspatial resolution, and/or box size, to test for resolution effects.\n\n\nThe fundamental numerical parameters of our simulation runs are listed in\nTable~\\ref{tab:simul}, where $N_p$ is the number of dark matter and gas\nparticles, $m_{\\rm DM}$ and $m_{\\rm gas}$ are their masses (initial mass in\nthe case of the gas). Finally, $\\epsilon $ gives the comoving gravitational\nsoftening length, and $z_{\\rm end}$ the final redshift of the simulation.\n\n\nFor the physical problem at hand we prefer relatively high resolution in order\nto capture the physics in high density regions appropriately, but we also need\na large volume to study the growth of deep gravitational potentials. Our\nchoice of $33.75\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ represents a compromise in this respect.\nWhile this box-size is too small to be evolved to redshifts lower than\n$z\\simeq 1$ (otherwise the fundamental mode would become non-linear), it is\nsufficiently large to provide a representative model for $L_\\star$-objects at\nhigher redshift, even though very rare systems in the exponential tail of the\nmass function will not be sampled well.  We also note that the choice of\nbox-size and particle number in the {\\it BHCosmo} run is such that the\nphysical resolution at $z\\sim 6$ is comparable to that in some of our previous\nworks on galaxy mergers, namely runs which used only $N\\simeq 10000$ particles\nfor each galaxy. In this prior work, we have shown that despite the low\nresolution the results for the black hole mass growth agreed well with those\nobtained in runs with 128 times higher resolution, and can therefore be\nconsidered converged with respect to this quantity. This overlap in\nresolution between our cosmological runs and our previous work on isolated\ngalaxy mergers gives us confidence that the results of our cosmological runs\nare not dominated by resolution effects, although it is clear that this needs\nto be tested separately.  We remark that as part of our previous work on\nmergers we have run a suite of several hundred galaxy merger simulations\n\\citep{Robertson2006a}, varying all the parameters describing star formation\nand feedback from supernovae and black hole growth and accretion, besides\ncarrying out numerical resolution studies. The galaxy merger simulations are\nclearly much better suited for investigating the full parameter space of our\nmodel, while for the cosmological runs we have to restrict ourselves to our\ndefault model owing to their much larger computational cost.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations, the choice of box-size in our new\nsimulations is also motivated by the set of simulations presented in\n\\citet{Springel2003b}. In fact, the {\\it BHCosmo} run would be called `D6' in\ntheir naming scheme. Being able to directly refer to their runs simplifies the\ncomparison of the physical properties of simulations with and without black\nholes, e.g.~with respect to the star formation history.\n\n%\\subsection{Convergence}\n\n%{\\bf (still missing subsection)}\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\\subsection{Visualization of the structure and black hole growth}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:D6slices}, we show slices through the {\\it BHCosmo}\nsimulation at a range of redshifts in order to visualize the evolution of the\nbaryonic density field and the growth of black holes.  The slice has a\nthickness of $5\\,h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc}$ and shows the full box of size $33.75\\,\nh^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on a side. In each panel, the projected gas density field is\ncolor-coded according to the gas temperature, with the brightness of each\npixel being proportional to the logarithm of the gas surface density. Circles\nof different size are drawn to mark the locations of BHs of different mass, as\nlabelled.\n\nThe images show that black holes emerge in halos starting at high redshift (as\nearly as $z\\sim 12$) and subsequently grow by gas accretion, driven by gas\ninflows that accompany the hierarchical build-up of ever larger halos through\nmerging. As the simulation evolves, the number of black holes rapidly\nincreases and larger halos host increasingly more massive black holes.  We\nnote that the particular slice of the box shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6slices}\ndoes not contain the largest black hole in the simulation's volume, which turns\nout to be located in the highest density region in the simulation.  We will\ndiscuss this region separately in later sections.\n\nBy plotting the density field color-coded by temperature we can also see\ntraces of heating effects from strong gas outflows, which are caused by black\nhole feedback and galactic winds from star formation. In our numerical mode,\nquasar-driven outflows occur once a central BH gas grown so much that its\nenergy feedback in accretion phases is able to transfer sufficient energy to\nthe remaining gas to unbind and expel part of it from the galaxy potential as\na wind. This then terminates further strong growth of the BH, which is key\nfactor in establishing a self-regulated nature of the growth of black holes in\nour model, as we discussed in detail in our previous work on galaxy merger\nsimulations.\n\nTo illustrate how well the mass resolution of the simulation captures details\nof galaxy formation sites, we zoom in onto a region of $6\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on\na side at $z=3$ (as indicated by the box drawn in Fig~\\ref{fig:D6slices}),\nshowing the gas density in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsgas}, and the stellar\ndensity of the same region in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsstars}. The middle\npanels (labeled B) in both figures show a second zoom-level into a region of\n$2\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on a side (indicated by the square in the A panels).\nFinally, the top panels show a further enlargement by a factor of 8.\n\nIn accordance with our seeding procedure, black holes are located in the\nhighest density regions. The more massive ones are found within the largest\nhalos, which have also undergone more prominent star formation. Such a\ncorrespondence is expected in our model since large-scale gas inflows into the\ncenters of halos lead both to star formation (and starbursts) as well as to\nnuclear black hole growth. In the highest level zoom of\nFigures~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsgas} and \\ref{fig:D6zoomsstars}, the central galaxy,\nwith an extent of $\\sim50h^{-1} {\\rm kpc}$ (comoving), has a very rough \ndisk-like morphology with a central stellar bulge.\nNevertheless, it is clear that our cosmological simulations in general still\nhave too low resolution for properly resolving galaxy morphologies. We also\nnote that producing disk galaxies with the right size and abundance in\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations is an essentially unsolved problem,\nand the outlook for obtaining a solution to this long-standing challenge has\nonly slightly improved by recent works on disk galaxy formation\n\\citep{Robertson2004, Governato2007, Okamoto2007}.\n%For our simulations, this implies that\n%they cannot be expected to be able to accurately resolve large amounts of cold\n%gas in centrifugal support in thin, gas-rich spirals. This probably leads to\n%inaccuracies in the detailed growth history of our central BHs.  Instead of\n%being `parked' at large radii until the final coalescence of two galaxies in a\n%major merger, the gas will be fed prematurely to the nuclei in our runs,\n%washing out some of the details of the time evolution of the merging systems.\n%However, our resolution tests demonstrate that even under conditions of very\n%poor resolution, quasar activity is triggered by mergers in a robust way and\n%the BH grows to the right final mass expected for the velocity dispersion of\n%the spheroid. \n\n\\subsection{The evolution of the global black hole mass density}\nThe black hole mass density at the present epoch is estimated from direct\nmeasurements of black hole masses in local galaxies (to establish, e.g., the\n$M_{\\rm BH}-M_\\star$ relationship), combined with a suitable integration over\nthe galaxy luminosity function ~\\citep{Fabian1999, YuTremaine2002,\nMarconi2004}. The local value thus obtained matches that of the total relic BH\nmass density estimated from a time integration of the luminosity output of\nactive galactic nuclei and quasars at X-ray and optical wavelengths\n\\citep{Soltan1982, Marconi2004, Shankar2004}, or in a less model-dependent\nmanner from an empirical determination of the bolometric quasar\nluminosity function \\citep{Hopkins2007b}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace*{-0.5cm}\\vspace*{-1.0cm}\\\\\n \\resizebox{9.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f4.ps}}\n\\caption{{\\it Top panel}: The global black hole mass density evolution in the\n{\\it BHCosmo}/D5 run, shown by a solid line.

The grey dotted line shows the stellar mass\ndensity in the D5 simulation which did not include black hole accretion and\nassociated quasar feedback ~\\citep{Springel2003a}. The thin dashed line shows\nthe results from the lower resolution box, D4 described in\nTable~\\ref{tab:simul}.

Most of the black hole and stellar\nmass is assembled by $z\\sim 2-3$, but the peak in the BHAR density function is\nfar more pronounced than that of the SFR density. }\n    \\label{fig:D6acc_den}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} shows our simulation prediction for the global\ndensity $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ and its evolution with redshift ({\\it thick black\n  line}). We find that the normalization of the black hole mass density is in\nagreement with the observational estimate of $\\rho_{\\rm BH} (0) =\n4.6^{+1.9}_{-1.4} \\times 10^{5} h_{0.7}^2 \\Msun \\Mpc^{-3}$ of\n\\citet{Marconi2004} and its extrapolation to $z\\sim 3$, derived by exploiting\nhard X-ray and optically selected AGNs and quasars.  The grey area in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} shows the region delimited by observational\nconstraints examined in detail in the literature \\citep[e.g][]{Salucci1999,\n  Marconi2004, Shankar2004}. The agreement we see here is very reassuring.  It\nshows that our black hole accretion and feedback model in the {\\it BHCosmo}\nrun is adequate and provides a realistic account for the dominant mode of\nglobal black hole growth in our universe.\n\nThe black hole mass density evolves rapidly at high redshift, increasing by\nfour orders of magnitude between $z \\sim 10$ to $z \\sim 3$. While below this\nredshift, there is some further growth, it only accounts for roughly a\ndoubling of the BH density down to $z= 1$. This is corroborated by the bottom\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}, where we plot the history of the global\nblack hole accretion rate (BHAR) density in our {\\it BHCosmo} run. It is\nevident that the black hole mass growth occurs mainly by accretion above $z\n\\sim 3$.  Indeed, the BHAR density rises steadily at early times to a peak at\n$z \\sim 3$, where it reaches a value $ \\sim 10^{-4} \\Msun \\yr^{-1} \\Mpc^{-3}$.\nBelow this redshift, it drops rather rapidly, becoming more than an order of\nmagnitude lower by $z= 1$.  We note that the 'spike' seen in the BHAR density\nat $z \\simeq 6.5$ is caused by a single object in the box, namely the rapid\nformation of the most massive black hole in the simulation at this epoch. We\nwill discuss the history of the corresponding halo and its embedded black hole\nin more detail in \\S 5.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-1cm}\n      \\resizebox{10.cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[width=4.in]{f5.ps}}\n    \\caption{The evolution of the black hole mass function in the {\\it\nBHCosmo} run.

We find that the final black hole mass function\nin our simulation (for $z=1$) is is quite good agreement with the one measured\nlocally, especially on the high-mass side. The $z=0$ constraint is indicated\nby the {\\em dark grey area} taken from the compilation of \\citet{Marconi2004},\nwhich is based on a combination of different observational data\n\\citep{kochanek2001, Nakamura2003, Bernardi2003, Sheth2003}. There is a small\ndeficit in our model at intermediate BH masses, but note that this will be\nfilled in at least partly by the expected residual growth from $z=1$ to $z=0$.\nThe {\\em light grey area} adds an additional constraint for the contribution\nof relic AGN, derived from an integration of the the hard X-ray luminosity\nfunction \\citep{Shankar2004}.  (Note that in this latter case the\nnormalization of the mass function depends on the value assumed for the\nradiative efficiency when converting from the luminosity function to the mass\nfunction.)\n \n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f7.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f7a.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n    \\caption{An illustration of a large group in the {\\it BHCosmo} run at\n$z=1$.  {\\it Left panel:} the gas density distribution. {\\it Right\npanel:} the stellar distribution.

However, it is\ninteresting that the mass function for high masses grows rather rapidly at\nearly times relative to the low mass end.  On the other hand, for redshifts $z\n\\lesssim 2$, the high mass end is virtually fully assembled while the BH mass\nfunction continues to grow for low to intermediate masses, leading effectively\nto a steepening of the mass function for $z \\simlt 3$.  This appears\nconsistent with the emerging observational picture of the evolution of the\nsupermassive black hole population according to which massive BHs ($M_{\\rm BH}\n\\simgt 10^9 \\Msun$) are assembled early and are then likely undergoing\ncomparatively passive evolution in the centers of large spheroids\n\\citep{Shields2003, Vestergaard2004, Adelberger2005}. More generally, this\nphenomenon is described by the idea of an `anti-hierarchical' black hole\ngrowth, or equivalently a `downsizing' of black hole activity\n\\citep{Merloni2004, Marconi2004}, which is derived from constraints on the\naccretion history from X-ray luminosity functions.\n\n%Intermediate mass BHs ($7.0 \\lesssim \\log\n%(M_{\\rm BH} / M_{\\sun}) \\lesssim 8.3$) in the mass function undergoing their\n%most significant evolution below $z\\sim 2$. The growth of the mass function in\n%this regime, contributes also to the slow climb of the black hole mass density\n%(Fig.~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} below $z \\sim 2$. The formation of the most massive\n%black holes (and spheroids) provides the dominant contribution to the global\n%black hole mass density.\n\nFinally, in Figure~\\ref{fig:bhaf}, we show the evolution of the corresponding\naccretion rate distribution function for the black holes in our simulation,\nexpressed in units of the Eddington rate. This function is strongly peaked at\na few percent below the critical Eddington value, with most black holes\naccreting at $10^{-2} \\lesssim \\mdot/\\mdot_{\\rm Edd} \\lesssim 1 $ at redshifts\n$z\\simgt 6$. The distribution becomes wider and develops a small amplitude\ntail at low Eddington rates for $ 6 < z < 3$.  Below $z \\sim 3$ the peak of\nthe accretion rate function shifts to $\\mdot/\\mdot_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 10^{-2} -\n10^{-3}$ and an increasingly large population of sources is present accreting\ndown to $10^{-6}$ Eddington. At $z\\sim 1$ the distribution function is\nextremely wide and dominated by sub-Eddington (to severely sub-Eddington)\nsources, in terms of number. While hence the number of sources accreting at\nsub-Eddington rates increases sharply with decreasing redshift, the\nquasar-like population, i.e.~the sources accreting close to Eddington,\ndecreases with decreasing redshift, with a maximum at $z\\sim 3$.  For $z\\sim\n1$, we also include in Figure~\\ref{fig:bhaf} measurements of the separate\ncontributions to the accretion rate function from three different black hole\nmass ranges.  The dotted line gives the Eddington ratio distribution for\n$M_{\\rm BH} > 10^{8} \\Msun$, and the dash-dotted and dot-dot-dashed lines\nare for masses $10^7 < M_{\\rm BH}/\\Msun \\le 10^{8}$ and $10^6 \\leq M_{\\rm\nBH}/\\Msun <10^{7}$, respectively.\n\nTaken together, the evolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate\nfunctions implies that most massive black holes assemble early and do so at\nclose to their critical rate. At low redshift, progressively lower\nluminosities and lower mass systems start dominating the black hole activity.\nThis is in accord with recent results from studies of the hard X-ray\nluminosity function of quasars and AGN, e.g.~typical Seyfert-like objects with\n$M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^7 - 10^8 \\Msun$ accreting at a few percent of the\nEddington rate~\\citep[e.g.][]{Ueda2003, Hasinger2005}.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison of the histories of black hole growth and star formation}In Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}, we have already shown and discussed the\nevolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate densities. In the\nsame Figure, we show corresponding results for the evolution of the\nstellar mass density, $\\rho_{*}$, and the star formation rate (SFR)\ndensity, with their normalizations rescaled by factors of $7\\times\n10^{-3}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively, for plotting purposes. For\ncomparison, we also include results for the D5 simulation of\n\\citet{Springel2003b} which did not include black holes and any\nassociated accretion or feedback processes (dotted grey lines).\n\nWe can see that $\\rho_{*}$ far exceeds $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ at all redshifts, with\n$\\rho_{*}$ evolving less strongly with redshift than $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ for $z\n\\simgt 3$. At early times, $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ rises more rapidly than the star\nformation density, while it tracks its evolution below this redshift. If we\nparameterize the ratio of $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\rho_{*}$ by an evolutionary factor\n$(1+z)^{\\alpha}$ we find that its evolution is approximately given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\rho_{*} \\sim \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\phi_{3} (1+z)^{-3} & \\mbox{if $z \\ge\n3.5$} \\nonumber \\\\ & \\\\ \\phi_1 [(1+z)]^{-0.6} & \\mbox{if $z <\n3.5$}\n\\end{array} \\right. , \\label{eq:rho}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $\\phi_{3} = 5 \\times 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\phi_{1}=2.2\\times10^{-3}$. Accordingly, up to $z\\sim 3$, the evolution of\nthe star formation rate density is considerably shallower than that of the\nblack hole accretion rate density. Below this redshift, the BHAR and SFR\ndensities closely track each other.  As a result, the BHAR density has much\nmore pronounced peak, which we find to lie at slightly lower redshift than the\npeak of the SFR. Parameterizing the evolution of the BHAR and SFR density\nratio with a power law in $(1+z)$ leads to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{\\rho_{BH}} / \\dot{\\rho}_{*} \\sim\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\dot{\\rho}_{3} (1+z)^{-4} & \\mbox{if $z \\ge\n3$} \\nonumber \\\\ & \\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_1 [(1+z)]^{-0.1} & \\mbox{if $z <\n3$}\n\\end{array} \\right. , \\label{eq:drho}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $\\dot{\\phi}_{3} = 0.2$ and $\\dot{\\phi}_{1} = 10^{-3}$. \n\nNote that Equations~(\\ref{eq:rho}) and (\\ref{eq:drho}) are only meant to\nprovide approximate scalings for our results from the simulations. The\nimportant point we want to emphasize is that our results imply a different and\nmuch stronger evolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate densities at\nhigh redshift relative to the stellar density and star formation rate density.\nThe black hole mass density tends to be assembled later than the stellar mass,\ndespite the growth of (a small number of) very massive BHs already at high\nredshift. However, for $z \\sim 3$ and below, our models predict that the black\nhole mass and stellar mass densities, as well as the BHAR and SFR densities,\nclosely track each other allowing only for small amounts of relative evolution\nbetween the two. \n\nAnother important point from Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} is that the feedback\nwe associate with black hole accretion does not significantly affect the\nglobal assembly of stellar mass. The peak of the SFR density is unaffected by\nthe inclusion of BH feedback, but the drop in SFR density ($z < 3$) is\nslightly more abrupt in the simulations with black holes. This effect becomes\nmore pronounced at $z\\sim 1$, the final redshift for our simulation.  At still\nlower redshift, we expect that BH feedback will become important in regulating\nthe cooling and star formation in very massive halos. This is then ascribed\nnot to quasar growth but rather to a `radio mode'. We explore this different\nfeedback channel in a companion paper by \\citet{Sijacki2007}.\n\n\\section{The $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{*}$ relations}\n\\label{msigmarel}\n\n\\subsection{Identification of groups and subgroups}\nAs a prerequisite for being able to study correlations between black\nhole and host galaxy properties in our simulation we first need to\napply a suitable group finding algorithm that reliably identifies the\nstellar mass associated with the different galaxies. Note that\nespecially the more massive halos identified by our basic\nfriends-of-friends grouping algorithm used for finding virialized\nobjects often contain a number of galaxies. This is illustrated in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:subgroups}, where we show a large cluster-sized group\nselected from the $z=1$ output of the {\\it BHCosmo} simulation. The\npanel on the left shows the gas density distribution in this large\ngroup, while the panel on the right hand side displays the stellar\ndistribution. It is evident that the group contains several,\ngravitationally bound galaxies.\n\nOur sub-group finder identifies all the galaxies within each group.  Our\nmethod to identify galaxies within a given group is based on a variant of the\n{\\small SUBFIND} algorithm \\citep{Springel2001}.  We first compute an\nadaptively smoothed baryonic density field for all stars and gas particles,\nallowing us to robustly identify centers of individual galaxies.  We find the\nextent of these galaxies by processing the gas and star particles in the order\nof declining density, adding particles one by one to the galaxies attached to\nthe galaxy to which its nearest denser neighbor already belongs~\\citep[see\nalso][]{Nagamine2004}. Note we are interested in the stellar and gas content\nof galaxies and associating the gaseous component to galaxies, as they\ntypically they contain very dense star-forming gas, makes the method very\nrobust in finding galaxies. This allows us to compute physical properties\nsuch as stellar mass, star formation rate, stellar velocity dispersion,\nmetallicity, black hole mass and BH accretion rate separately for each\ngalaxy. As an illustration, Figure~\\ref{fig:subgroups} shows the stellar\ndistribution associated with the largest galaxy in the group (which also hosts\nthe most massive BH in the group) in yellow.\n\nFor each galaxy/subgroup that contains stars and a black hole, we calculate the\nprojected (spherically averaged) half-mass effective radius, $R_e$, and the\nmass-weighted stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ within $R_e$.  Note however\nthat in order to make the measurements of $\\sigma$ and $R_e$ somewhat accurate\nwe only consider those objects that contain more than 100 stars particles\nwithin $R_e$.  This determination of $\\sigma$ closely resembles the procedure\nfor measuring the velocity dispersion from observational data\n\\citep{Gebhardt2000}, allowing for a direct comparison.\n\n\\subsection{The predicted $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\n  relationships and their evolution} Figures~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} and\n\\ref{fig:mbhmstar} plot the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelations, respectively, for our simulated galaxies at redshifts $z=1$, $2$,\n$3$, $4$, $5$ and $6.5$ (from top left to bottom right). Each measurement is\ncolor-coded according to the accretion rate of the corresponding black\nhole. We find a strong power-law correlation between both the velocity\ndispersion and the stellar mass with the black hole mass. Furthermore, at\n$z=1$, these correlations agree very well with the ones observed at the\npresent epoch~\\citep{Ferrarese2000, Gebhardt2000, Tremaine2002, Haring2004} \nover a large dynamic range. This is a remarkable confirmation of the basic\nmerger-driven scenario for self-regulated BH growth that we previously\nexplored in isolated high-resolution galaxy merger simulations. Based on the\nsame model, and without any fine-tuning or change of the model parameters, we\nhere obtain a good match to the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation\ndirectly from simulations that start from cosmological initial conditions and\nself-consistently account for the hierarchical build up galaxies in a\n$\\Lambda$CDM universe.\n\n\\subsubsection{The evolution of $M_{\\rm BH} -\\sigma$}\nAt higher redshifts, and in particular for $z > 3$, our results for the\n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation shows some degree of evolution relative to the\nlocal relations. To compare with the local  data as a function of time,\n we\nfit the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation at each redshift \nwith a simple power-law of the form \\beq \\log \\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm\n      BH}}{\\Msun}\\right) = a\\, \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{200 \\kmps}\\right) + b.\n\\label{eqn:msigmafit}\n\\eeq The best-fit relations thus obtained are shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} as solid black lines, with the dispersion indicated\nby hatched regions. The dotted lines are the best-fit relations for all\nredshifts combined. We compare with the observed relation as determined by\nT02, which is described by a slope $a=4.02$, a normalization $b=8.2$ and a\ndispersion $\\Delta \\sim 0.25-0.30$ (grey thick line in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma}).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Parameters of best-fit $M_{\\rm BH} -\\sigma$ relations}\n\\label{tab:msigma}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\\\\\nz  &  slope (a) & normalization, (b) & scatter $\\Delta$ & slope (a$_{s}$)\\\\\n \\hline\\\\\n1 ....... &  $3.95\\pm 0.10$ & $8.29\\pm0.03$ & 0.10 & 3.9  \\\\\n2 ....... &  $4.01\\pm 0.15$ & $8.42\\pm0.04$ & 0.16 & 4.1  \\\\\n3 ....... &  $4.21\\pm 0.22$ & $8.32\\pm0.07$ & 0.23 & 5.2 \\\\\n4 ....... &  $4.54\\pm 0.35$ & $8.17\\pm0.10$ & 0.36 & 6.7 \\\\\n5 ....... &  $3.37\\pm 0.45$ & $7.70\\pm0.13$ & 0.47 &  --   \\\\\n6.5 ..... &  $3.26\\pm 0.85$ & $7.50\\pm0.25$ & 0.89 &  --  \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe constants $a$ and $b$ for our best-fit relations and their dispersions are\ntabulated in Table~\\ref{tab:msigma} for different redshifts.  Note that we\nhere do not attempt to assess the statistical significance of the correlations\nin detail as the sources of systematic errors in the numerical measurements of\n$\\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$ cannot be easily quantified in the simulations.  In\nparticular, the cosmological simulations cannot determine the morphological\nproperties of galaxies and therefore do not provide a direct measure\nof spheroid masses or their velocity dispersions.  Our\nfitting procedure is merely intended to provide a first characterization of\nthe overall evolution of the slope and normalization of the relations in the\nsimulation model.  As Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} and Table~\\ref{tab:msigma}\nindicate, the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation predicted from our simulation is\nconsistent with a slope $\\sim 4$ at low redshift, as observed. At $z=3-4$, the\nslope appears to be slightly steeper and at $z=5-6$ slightly shallower, but the\nsmall number of systems at $z \\sim 6$ makes the latter trend uncertain.\n\nInspection of Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} shows a qualitative trend whereby the\nlarger systems with high $\\sigma \\simgt 150 \\kmps$ (which are also those that\nare best resolved in our simulation) appear to populate the high mass end of\nthe $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation already at $z > 2-3$.  The lower mass end of\nthe $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation is then increasingly filled in towards $z\\sim\n1$. To illustrate this trend more explicitly, we perform a fit of the relation\nusing only those systems with $\\sigma \\ge 150\\kmps$; this is shown by the\ndashed line in Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma}. The slope $a_{s}$ obtained for these\n`high' $\\sigma$ black holes is typically steeper than for the full relation\n(our measured values for $a_{s}$ are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:msigma}). At a\nfixed and relatively high $\\sigma$, the mean $M_{\\rm BH}$ is larger at $z\\sim\n3-4$ than at $z\\sim 1$.  This trend suggests that black hole growth predates\nthe final growth of the spheroid potential at scales $\\sigma \\sim 170\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the recent measurements of the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ relation in a sample of Seyferts at $z\\sim 0.35$ by\n\\citet{Woo2006}. This relatively more efficient black hole growth at a fixed\n$\\sigma$ at high redshift may thus be responsible for a mild change in the\nhigh mass end of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation. In the remainder of this\nsection we will discuss possible additional dependences in the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ \\citep{Hopkins2007a} relation which may produces a small change in\nthe slope of the relation with time.\n\nNote also that at $z \\ge 4$ black holes are more likely to accrete close to\ntheir critical Eddington rates, as we showed earlier. In our models, the\n$M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation is a natural consequence of the self-regulated\ngrowth of black holes \\citep{DiMatteo2005}, where a black hole grows until its\nreleased energy is sufficient to expel the gas in its surroundings in a quasar\ndriven wind, which then terminates nuclear accretion. For this reason, we\nexpect the relation to show more scatter at times when most systems are still\nactively growing and accreting close to their Eddington values (see\nTable~\\ref{tab:msigma}). This is expected as the primary path for assembly BH\nmass is via accretion during major mergers so that the relations converge and\nget increasingly tighter as galaxies undergo major mergers and continue to\nmerge.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace*{-0.4cm}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f10.ps}}\n\\caption{The stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ versus stellar\n$M_{*}$ at $z=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6.5$ (indicated by different\ncolors from blue to pink, the same ones as used in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}-\\ref{fig:bhaf}).

The simulation agrees well with the conjecture of a\nBHFP, which confirms the overall trends we have found in the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations.

Below $z \\sim 3$, there is virtually no evolution (bearing in\nmind the weak trend discussed above for $\\sigma > 150 \\kmps$), while\nwe find a weak drift of the normalization beyond $z\\sim 3$.  A rough\nparameterization of this evolution in the normalization of the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ relation is given by $ M_{\\rm BH}/\\sigma^4 \\propto\n(1+z)^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha =-0.2$.\n\nThese results for an overall modest evolution in the normalization are in\nqualitative agreement with those from an analysis of isolated galaxy merger\nsimulations by \\citet{Robertson2006a}.  We note that in the latter study a\nredshift scaling of galaxy properties and a specific set of structural\nproperties of the merging galaxies had to be assumed, which introduced an\nimportant systematic uncertainty. While having lower numerical resolution per\nmerger, the simulation we analyze here eliminates this caveat by providing a\nfully self-consistent cosmological history for the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies and their black holes (albeit at a lower spatial resolution). This\nprovides an important confirmation of the analysis of \\citet{Robertson2006a},\nwho however did not find evidence for an evolution of the slope at the high\nmass end of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation.\n\n%Note that, as shown in the isolated merger studies, the normalization of the\n%$M_{BH}-\\sigma$ relationship is also set by adjusting the feedback\n%parameter, $\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$. As we have kept this fixed at $5\\%$ consistent\n%with these latter studies, the slope of the relations is not adjustable or\n%tunable but a natural consequence of the self-regulated black hole growth.\n\n%here\n\n\\subsubsection{The evolution of $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhmstar}, we show the $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relation\nfrom the simulations at $z=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ and $6.5$, alongside\nthe local observational relation determined by \\citet[][thick grey\nlines]{Haring2004}. Our best-fit relation at each redshift is shown by\na solid line while the dotted lines in each panel show results for the\nother redshifts. Table~\\ref{tab:mbhmstar} gives the slope $c$,\nnormalization $d$, and dispersion $\\Delta_m$ for our best-fit\nrelations of the form\n\\beq \\log \\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm BH}}{\\Msun}\\right) = c \\log\n\\left(\\frac{M_{*}}{10^{11} \\Msun}\\right) + d.\n\\label{eqn:mbhmstarfit}\n\\eeq As before, our fitted values for $c$ and $d$ are intended to\nindicate general trends in the evolution rather than to be used as\nstatistically rigorous measurements.  The observed relationship\n\\citep{Haring2004} has a slope $c=1.12$ and normalization $d=8.2$.\n\nOverall there appears to be only limited evolution in the $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelation, but there is a slight steepening at $z=2-4$.  To highlight this\ntrend, we restrict our fits to the high mass end with $M_{*}\\ge 5\\times\n10^{10}\\Msun$ (dashed line in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mbhmstar}). In this range, the\nrelation is significantly steeper, implying slopes $c_s \\sim 1.9$ at $z=3-4$\nand $\\sim 1.5$ at $z\\sim 2$.  This is more significant than the evolution\nfound in the slope of $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$, and implies that there is some\nevolution in the ratio of black hole mass to stellar mass relative to the\nlocal observations. More precisely, systems with $M_{*} \\simgt 10^{10} \\Msun$\nhave larger black hole masses at fixed $M_{*}$ than at $z=1$, where the ratio\nis in good agreement with the relation observed at the present epoch.  This\ntrend of an increasing $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}$ ratio as a function of redshift\nappears consistent with the recent measurements of high redshift (up to $z\n\\sim 3.5$) BH masses and host luminosities by \\citet{Peng2006},\nas well as the BHFP \\citep{Hopkins2007a}. We will\nfurther analyze this effect in \\S~\\ref{sec:fgas}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Parameters of best-fit $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relations}\n\\label{tab:mbhmstar}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\\\\\n$z$  &  slope $c$ & normalization $d$ & scatter $\\Delta$ & c$_{s}$\\\\\n \\hline\\\\\n1 ....... &  $1.18\\pm0.02$ & $8.10\\pm0.03$ & 0.03 &1.2 \\\\\n2 ....... &  $1.23\\pm0.03$ & $8.09\\pm0.03$ & 0.04 & 1.5 \\\\\n3 ....... &  $1.25\\pm 0.04$ & $8.04\\pm0.04$ & 0.06 & 1.9 \\\\\n4 ....... &  $1.30\\pm 0.05$ & $8.04\\pm0.05$ & 0.07 &1.9 \\\\\n5 ....... &  $1.17\\pm 0.10$ & $7.90\\pm0.10$ & 0.14 & 2.0 \\\\\n6.5 ..... &  $1.01\\pm 0.22$ & $7.78\\pm0.25$ & 0.34 & -- \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Evolution of $\\sigma$, gas fraction, and $R_e$,\n at fixed stellar host mass}\n\\label{sec:fgas}\nWe now analyze some of the physical properties of the host galaxies\nand their evolution with redshift to investigate the physical origin\nfor the trends we have found in the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm\nBH} -M_{*}$ relations.  Figure~\\ref{fig:sigma_mstar} shows the stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$ versus the stellar mass $M_{*}$ for each\ngalaxy as a function of redshift. The dotted lines and the solid line\n(for $z=1$) show our best-fit relations. At a fixed $M_{*}$, the\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$ increases with increasing redshift. This\nis consistent with the results from the merger remnants in\n\\citet{Robertson2006a} and reflects changes in the structural\nproperties of stellar spheroids, which become smaller towards higher\nredshift.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:fgasre}, we show the projected half mass radius $R_e$, the\ncold gas fraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ (a proxy for the disk gas fraction), and the\n$\\left<M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}\\right>$ ratio as a function of redshift. We show\nresults for systems with $M_{*} \\ge 3 \\times 10^{10} \\Msun$ (dashed lines) and\n$M_{*} \\ge 6 \\times 10^{10} \\Msun$ (solid lines). We find higher cold gas\nfractions in higher redshift systems with $f_{gas} \\propto\n(1+z)^{1.5}$. The increased gas content, dissipation rate in high redshift\nprogenitor is consistent with them being more centrally concentrated, as\nshown by the trend of decreasing $R_{e}$ and increasing $\\sigma$ with\nincreasing redshift, leading to larger ratios $M_{\\rm BH} /M_{*}$ at high\nredshifts, with $M_{\\rm BH} /M_{*} \\sim (1+z)^{0.5}$, at least over these\nranges of $M_{*}$. Larger values of $\\sigma$ at fixed $M_{*}$ at high redshift\nare also consistent with an inverse overall trend (e.g.; $(1+z)^{-0.2}$) in\nthe evolution of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation.\n\nThe above results are consistent with the general picture for a merger-driven\nquasar growth we have developed based on our galaxy merger\nsimulations~\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a, Robertson2006a, Hopkins2005,\nHopkins2006a, Hopkins2007a} , which also implies that the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$\nand $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations are connected to each other. This connection\nis most clearly demonstrated by the `black hole fundamental plane' (BHFP)\nrelation discussed by \\citet{Hopkins2007a}, which arises from the joint\nformation process of spheroids and massive black holes in mergers. Our\ncosmological simulations also should agree with the BHFP if most of the BH\ngrowth is associated with mergers.  In Figure~\\ref{fig:fplane}, we show our\nsimulation measurements for the BHFP and compare it to the the best-fit from\n\\citet{Hopkins2007a}, shown as a solid line.  We find very good agreement with\nthe predictions for the BHFP by \\citet{Hopkins2007a}, in both of its\nformulations, i.e.~for $R_e$ and $\\sigma$ or $M_{*}$ and $\\sigma$, although\nthe former shows a larger scatter than the latter, owing to the noisy\nmeasurements of $R_e$ in the cosmological simulation.\n\n\n\\section{The first and the most massive black holes}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{17.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f13.ps}}\\vspace*{-1.8cm}\n\\end{center}\n \\caption{Individual mass assembly and accretion rate histories for\nthe six most massive black holes and two intermediate mass BHs (chosen\nrandomly) in the {\\it BHCosmo} run.

From the bottom panels we see that phases of high\nEddington accretion occur at different times of the history of\ndifferent black holes.\n\\label{fig:accrhistD6}}\n\\end{figure*}\nIn the previous sections we have discussed the predictions from our\nsimulation for the global history of black hole mass assembly in\ngalaxies from the high redshift Universe to today. We have compared\nthe predictions for the evolution of the black hole mass and accretion\nrate density to the history of the star formation rate density and\ndiscussed the growth of the black hole mass function.  We have also\ndiscussed the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelationships as a function of time, and examined which physical\nproperties drive their cosmological evolution.\n\nHowever, our simulation methodology not only allows us to make statistical\nstatements about the black hole population. Rather, it can also be used to\nstudy the detailed growth history of individual black holes, from the moment\nthey are seeded to today, which provides a particularly powerful way to follow\nthe evolution of black holes over cosmic time. The gas which fuels black hole\nactivity ultimately has its origins in the intergalactic medium, draining\nalong filaments into forming galaxies. Because of this, BH radiative histories\nare directly linked to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe,\nfrom supercluster scales down to the immediate environment of host galaxies.\nBeing able to follow these large-scale processes and their impact on\nindividual black holes self-consistently is the key to a qualitatively better\nlevel of understanding. For example, we have the tools to examine what turns a\nsmall black hole into a supermassive one at $z=6$, or whether some BHs grow\nhardly at all after this initial phase (as we shall see below in some\nexamples). We can ask how quasar lifetimes are related to their clustering,\nhow important BH mergers versus gas accretion are in the cosmological growth\nof BH mass, what BH light curves look like in detail over a Hubble time,\nand how specific outbursts correlate with galaxy and cluster merger and\naccretion events.\n\nIn future work we will return to address such questions in more detail; for\nexample in \\citet{Colberg07} we present an extensive study of BH environments\nas the universe evolves.  For now we will show that there are some striking\ninferences to be drawn from following the detailed histories of even a few\nblack holes.  As an example we choose to focus on the formation and fate of\nthe first large black holes that form in our simulation, as well as the\nproperties of their hosts and their descendants. This allows us to identify\nthe prerequisite conditions for the growth of supermassive black holes already\nin the early universe.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{17.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=270]{f14.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n \\caption{Time evolution of the environment around the host galaxy of\nthe first supermassive massive black hole at $z=6$ (bottom panels),\nand of the most massive BH at $z=1$ (top panels) in the {\\it BHcosmo}\nrun.

Their low space density suggests\nthat they reside in the rarest dark matter density peaks at this early\nepoch, yet the apparent lack of companion galaxies in the field has\nbeen used to argue that these quasars reside in far more common halos\n\\citep{Carilli2004, Willott2005}. Extensive follow-up observations of\nthe highest redshift ($z=6.42$) quasar, SDSS J11148+5251, are starting\nto constrain the properties of its host galaxy \\citep{Walter2004}.  CO\nobservations indicate a relatively small stellar spheroid, however,\nthe existence of CO, iron and carbon emission indicates a heavily\nenriched ISM and vigorous star formation \\citep{Maiolino2005}. In any\ncase, rapid growth is clearly required to produce large supermassive\nblack holes and spheroids in the $\\sim 800$ million years available to\n$z\\sim 6$.  Unsurprisingly, the type of object associated with the\n'first quasar' is therefore still a matter of debate.\n\n%Because of the rarity - models assume 10^13 mass halos - millenium run\n%pick the halo here we do not pick --- this is the major difference...\n% WRITE SOME OF THIS STUFF>>..\n\nThe relatively small volume of our simulation prevents us from directly\naddressing the problem of the `first quasars', simply because their space\ndensity is so low. Properly identifying one of the rare host systems requires\nat the very least box-sizes of $500\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$\n\\citep{SpringelMillennium2005}, or more adequately $1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}$\n\\citep{Li2007}.  Nevertheless, our simulation allows us to examine the nature\nof the environments and the hosts where exponential growth of BHs can first\noccur at early times. This has some relevance to the problem of where the\nfirst quasars are likely to form.\n\nIn order to retrieve the required information for all the black holes in the\nsimulation we have constructed full merger trees for each of them. This allows\nus to track the growth and accretion history of individual black holes of\ndifferent masses, make detailed lightcurves from their accretion histories,\nand study the properties of their host galaxies.\n\n\n\\subsection{Individual BH mass and accretion rate as function of $z$}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6}, we show the accretion histories of a\nnumber of black holes in the {\\it BHCosmo} run (top panel) and some\nexamples of their corresponding accretion rate histories in the bottom\nfour panels. The sample in the top panel consists of the six most\nmassive black holes in the simulation and two randomly chosen ones\nwith an intermediate mass at $z=1$. The four bottom panels show the\naccretion rate in units of Eddington for four black holes with\ncorresponding line colors, including the most massive black hole at\n$z=6$, the most massive and second most massive at $z=1$, and finally\none of the intermediate mass ones.  Note that this is a small\nsub-sample of the several thousand black holes in the simulation. We\nfocus here on the evolution of the most massive ones, and in\nparticular on their early formation and the fate of their descendants.\nIn \\citet{Colberg07}, we study a complete sample of individual BH\nhistories as a function of environments for the entire simulation.\n\nThe first interesting result shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6} is\nthat even in this small volume conditions exist that are conducive for\nexponential black hole growth, as required by the presence of quasars\nat $z\\sim 6$ with the large observed masses. The evolution of the mass\nof the largest black hole in our simulation at early times is shown by\nthe thick pink line.  The corresponding accretion rate history (in the\nsame color) shows a rapid succession of numerous phases of high\naccretion at the critical Eddington rate, between $ 5 \\simlt z \\simlt\n7.5$. Below $z\\sim5$, the black hole is drastically more quiescent,\nexcept for a couple of sporadic Eddington phases at around $z\\sim 2$.\nInterestingly, this first most massive black hole at $z \\sim 6$ is not\nthe most massive one at $z=1$. Instead, it is `overtaken' in growth by\nanother black hole shown with the blue thick line, which is the most\nmassive black hole at the end of the simulation.  The Eddington growth\nphases for this objects start at $z < 6$ and extend all to way to\n$z\\sim 3.5$. By $z \\sim 4.5$, the black hole mass in this system\ncatches up with that of the first massive black hole, and then keeps\ngrowing exponentially to $z\\sim4$.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:2bigbhs}, we show projected gas density maps of the\nhost galaxies and the surrounding structures (at redshifts $z=7.5$,\n$4$, and $1.6$) for two of these black holes, the one that is most\nmassive at $z=1$, and the one that is most massive at $z=6$.  This\nprovides good clues for the origin of the evolutionary difference\nbetween these two systems. Although the hosts of both black holes at\n$z=7.5$ are halos of similar mass, $\\sim 10^{10} \\Msun$, one of them\nlies at the intersection of three small filaments, leading to\nefficient gas cooling and a high star formation of $\\sim 100\n\\Msun$yr$^{-1}$. The host galaxy grows rapidly until $z=6$ but then\nits gas supply dwindles, and at $z\\sim4$ it is overtaken by the other\nblack hole.  This latter one lies on a very massive filament, which\ngrows even more vigorously at this later time than its host galaxy\n(which has a SFR of $\\sim 1000 \\Msun$yr$^{-1}$ at $z\\sim 2$). In this\nway a large stellar spheroid is produced around the BH, which\neventually will end up at the center of a rich cluster of galaxies.\nOur results therefore show that a massive black hole that is found in\nthe cD of large galaxy cluster at late times was not necessarily the\nmost massive one at $z=6$, as it has been often assumed in the\nliterature \\citep[e.g.][]{SpringelMillennium2005}. Since the growth\nhistory of black holes is intertwined with the non-linear processes of\nstructure formation, individual growth histories of BHs can be complex\nand need not preserve the rank order in a group of BHs that start out\nwith similar masses.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-0.5cm}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f15.ps}}\n \\caption{Comparison of individual black hole mass histories in the\n{\\it BHCosmo} run (blue lines, D6) and in the larger simulation volume\nof the E6 run (red lines).

In this larger volume, there are a\nhandful of more examples of early exponential black hole growth\nbetween $8\\simlt z \\simlt 6$, as shown by the red black hole mass\ngrowth curves in Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6E6}.  Consistent with our\nprevious finding, there are again black holes that 'catch-up' in\ngrowth to the most massive black hole at some earlier time. We note\nthat we have run this larger volume simulation with the specific\npurpose of checking the {\\it BHCosmo} results for the first\nsupermassive black holes by obtaining better statistics for large\nhalos at $z\\simgt 6$. For this reason, this simulations was not\nevolved beyond $z=4$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{BH merger trees for the first and the most massive black hole}\nFigures~\\ref{fig:tree1} and \\ref{fig:tree6} show two example black\nhole merger trees, one for the most massive black hole at $z=1$, and\none for the $z=1$ descendant of the first supermassive black hole at $z\n\\sim 6$. All progenitor black holes that merge together to build up\nthe final BH are included in the trees.  The black hole masses along\nthe tree are represented by different sizes of the circles, while the\ncolor encodes their accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate.  In\nboth figures, the top-left panel shows the full BH merger tree,\nwhereas the top-right and bottom two panels split the tree according\nto accretion rate of the BHs.\n\nInspection of these two BH trees immediately reveals a complex and\nrich merger history for the most massive black holes at $z=1$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:tree1}), as opposed to the comparatively isolated\nevolution of the most massive object at $z=6$, which only features\nthree major branches for its tree (Fig.~\\ref{fig:tree6}). The large\nmajority of the mass in the latter case is built up by early phases of\ncritical gas accretion at $z \\simlt 6$. On the other hand, in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:tree1}, Eddington accretion phases are spread out\nalong many branches of the tree and cover a much larger range of\nredshifts.  At redshifts $z < 3$, the progenitors are preferentially\naccreting at low Eddington rates, so that the residual growth of the final\nblack hole mass increasingly occurs from ``dry'' mergers with other\nblack holes, consistent with our earlier results for the global black\nhole growth.\n\n\n\\section{Summary and discussion\\label{sec:conclusions}}\nIn this paper we have investigated the coupled formation and evolution\nof black holes and galaxies using state-of-the-art cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. For the first\ntime, we have incorporated black hole growth and associated feedback\nfrom quasar activity self-consistently in cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our approach has been based on the methodology recently\ndeveloped and tested in simulations of galaxy mergers\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a}. In this initial paper we have\nfocused on investigating the model predictions for (i) the global\nhistory of black hole mass assembly and its relation to the history of\nstar formation, from high redshift to the present, for (ii) the\nevolution of the BH mass function and accretion rate function and its\nconnection to the observational ``downsizing'' phenomenon, for (iii)\nthe correlations between black hole mass, velocity dispersion, and\nstellar mass of host galaxies, and finally, for (iv) the formation and\nfate of the first quasars and the properties of their hosts.\n\nAn important and highly encouraging first result has has been that the\ncosmological black hole mass density $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ predicted by our\nhigh-resolution simulation reproduces the locally measured value and\nits extrapolation to higher redshift ($z< 2.5$), inferred from\nintegrating the X-ray luminosity functions \\citep{YuTremaine2002, Marconi2004,\nShankar2004}, or, more directly, the bolometric quasar\nluminosity function \\citep{Hopkins2007b}.\nWe predict a steep evolution of $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ as a\nfunction of redshift, with a rise that is more rapid than that of the\nstar formation rate. At $z > 3$, $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*} \\propto\n(1+z)^{-3}$ whereas there is at most weak evolution in the ratio\n$\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*}$ at $z \\lesssim 3$. Similarly, whilst the star\nformation rate density $\\dot\\rho_{*}$ broadly tracks the BHAR density\n$\\dot\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ below $z\\sim 2.5-3$, their ratio evolves steeply\nat higher redshifts, as $\\dot\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\dot\\rho_{*} \\propto\n(1+z)^{-4}$.  The SFR density peaks earlier than the BHAR density and\nexhibits a more gradual evolution with redshift compared to the BHAR.\nOnly at redshifts below the peak of the BHAR, the BHAR and SFR rate\ndensities start tracking each other.\n\nOur results for the evolution of the BHAR density are broadly\nconsistent with constraints obtained by \\citet{Hopkins2007b} from a\ncomprehensive analysis of a large sample of observational data sets,\nwhich allowed them to synthesize the evolution of the bolometric\nquasar luminosity density with redshift and to show that the\nluminosity density indeed peaks at $z\\sim 2-3$, with a sharp drop\ntowards higher redshifts.\n\n\nWe have shown that the growth of the black hole mass function shows\nsigns of `anti-hierarchical' behavior, or `downsizing'.  The high mass\nend of the BH mass function is established at comparatively high\nredshift and then significantly slows down in evolution below $z \\sim\n2$, where only the abundance of intermediate mass BHs is still growing\nappreciably.  We have found more direct evidence for black hole\n``downsizing'' by inspecting the distribution of accretion rates, in\nunis of the critical Eddington rate. The accretion rate function\nshifts from a narrow distribution dominated by high Eddington rates at\nhigh redshift to a broad distribution with a small fraction of\nEddington accretion for low redshifts ($z < 3$). High mass black holes,\nforming in the high density peaks at high redshift are built up\nrapidly by vigorous accretion. However, the effects of gas depletion\nand AGN feedback drive a strong decline in the accretion rate of\nmassive black holes towards late times, while during these later times\nthe peak of the accretion activity shifts to progressively smaller\nmass scales.\n\n%Gas depletion in large halos and suppression of further cooling by feedback\n%processes are likely to play a role in these trends.\n\nThe BH masses of our simulated galaxies are strongly correlated with the\nstellar velocity dispersions and stellar masses of their host galaxies, and\nthe correlations agree remarkably well with the local $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$\nand $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relationships, over a large dynamic range. We\npreviously showed with simulations of isolated galaxy mergers\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Robertson2006a, Hopkins2007a} that our AGN feedback\nprescription leads to a self-regulated BH growth that can explain the \n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation. \nIt is highly reassuring that the same simulation\nmodel, with an unmodified feedback efficiency $\\epsilon_f$ reproduces the\nobserved $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ in full cosmological simulations as well. We\nemphasize that the free parameter $\\epsilon_f$ sets the normalization of the\nobtained relationship, but the slope and scatter of the relation obtained from\nthe simulations are not adjustable and a non-trivial consequence of the\nself-regulated BH growth.\n\nOur simulation also suggests a weak evolution with redshift of the\nnormalization of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation, as $M_{\\rm BH}\n/\\sigma \\sim (1+z)^{-0.2}$. However, we find that this evolutionary\ntrend is sensitive to range of masses being probed. When we focus on\nthe better resolved more massive systems, there appears to be some\nmild evolution in the slope of the BH scaling relations at high\n$\\sigma$ and for high $M_{*}$. In particular, we find a trend of\nincreasing $M_{*}/ M_{\\rm BH}$ with redshift, in agreement with recent\ndirect estimates of the BH to host stellar mass ratio at high redshift\nby \\citet{Peng2006}. This trend is accompanied by an increase in the\ncold gas fraction in the host galaxy, and a smaller $R{_e}$ at a fixed\nstellar mass.  These results are consistent with the suggestion that\nthe $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations are\nprojections of a more basic correlation,\nthe black hole fundamental plane \\citep{Hopkins2007a}, \n$M_{\\rm BH} \\propto \\sigma^3\nR_{e}^{0.5}$, and the interpretation that gas-rich systems at high\nredshift produce more dissipative mergers that lead to more\nconcentrated BH hosts.\n\n\nOur findings for the BH scaling relations appear fully consistent with a\nscenario where quasar activity is driven by galaxy mergers, as suggested by\nour simulations of isolated mergers \\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a,\nRobertson2006a, Hopkins2006a, Hopkins2007a}. While gas is available for star\nformation over a large range of mass scales, it can only gets to central\nregions of galaxies in large amounts as a result of the inflows that accompany\nmajor mergers. At the same time, the mergers produce spheroids, which together\nwith the growth-limiting quasar feedback establishes the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$\nrelationship.  The detailed time evolution of the quasar activity in an\nindividual galaxy depends on the angular momentum of the gas and the disk size\nand morphology. It is clear that the limited spatial resolution of our\ncosmological simulation is a severe limitation on how faithfully this can be\ntracked in our calculation, but because the final BH masses in merger remnants\nare robustly predicted by our simulation methodology even at coarse resolution\nthis does not seriously affect the quantities we study here.\n\nOur simulated volumes are too small to directly check if a population\nof supermassive black holes as massive the $z\\sim 6$ Sloan quasars can\nform at high redshift. However, we do find that our simulation model\nproduces black holes at early times that spend a large fraction of\ntheir time at high accretion rates close to their Eddington rates. We\ntherefore predict the presence of massive black holes at high\nredshift. Using high-resolution simulations of multiple mergers that\nwere constructed to represent a high redshift merging tree of one of\nthe most massive protocluster regions in a $(1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$\nvolume, \\citet{Li2007} have recently made the match with the Sloan\nquasar much more explicit. They were able to show that the gas-rich\nmergers expected in this rare overdensity can indeed grow a BH of mass\n$\\sim 10^{9}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ early enough.\n\nWe have also found that the first supermassive black hole in our simulation\nforms in relative isolation, as a result of strong gas inflows and merging at\nthe intersection of large-scale filaments. However, by following this system\nto lower redshift it turned out that it did not evolve into the most massive\nblack hole today. Instead, it was overtaken in growth by a black hole that\nacquired most of its mass in major mergers in a high density region at lower\nredshift. Such a change in the relative rank of BHs as a function of time\nappears quite generic, as we explicitly checked with a simulation of larger\nvolume. This clearly complicates attempts to directly link high redshift\nprogenitor systems to low redshift descendants. As we have demonstrated, the\ncosmological simulation methodology we introduced here provides however an\nexcellent tool for studying the evolution of the cosmic BH evolution. In the\npresent study, we focused only on the radiatively efficient accretion mode of\nAGN, which is associated with quasar activity. For following AGN activity also\nin clusters of galaxies, and hence down to $z=0$ in large volumes, we also\nneed to account radio activity, which becomes important in very massive halos\nat low redshift. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we present an extension of our\nsimulation methodology that accounts for this physics, and we discuss results\nobtained with this unified model for AGN feedback both for clusters of\ngalaxies and cosmological boxes.\n \nOur cosmological approach to black hole formation enables us to follow the\nfuel for black hole activity from its ultimate source, the early intergalactic\nmedium, and so link the large-scale structure and environments of black holes\ndirectly with their growth. As a result, countless different avenues of\nresearch are opened up and we plan to explore many in future work. For\nexample, in \\citet{Colberg07} we use merger trees constructed for every black\nhole in the simulation to carry out a systematic study of their environments\nand histories and to determine the amount of black hole growth owing to\nmergers versus gas accretion; the latter should be testable with upcoming\ngravitational wave experiments. Future issues which will be addressed include\nthe nature of AGN clustering and its evolution and its relation to the\nunderlying dark matter clustering, predictions for quasar lifetimes and\nluminosity functions, and how feedback from AGN may manifest itself on\nlarge-scales and can be detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. With\nour new approach we can address the question of how the first black hole\nformed and grew we will be able to make predictions for the ionizing\nbackground owing to the first miniquasars, an important but currently uncertain\ningredient in current models of reionization.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe thank Rupert Croft for many discussions and reading the manuscript.\nThe simulations were performed at Carnegie Mellon University and the\nPittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC). \nThis work has been supported in part through NSF AST-0607819.\n\n%We thank Karen Tozzi, for design...\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apj}\n\\bibliography{ms}\n\n\n\\end{document}\n\n\n"}

In fact, the prediction of BBN changes\nsignificantly if there exists an exotic massive particle with long\nlifetime.  (Hereafter, we call such a particle $X$.)  When the lifetime\nof $X$ is longer than about 1 sec, the decay of $X$ may induce\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers, which lead to photo- and\nhadro-dissociation of ${\\rm ^4He}$ and subsequent non-thermal production\nof other light elements (${\\rm D}$, ${\\rm ^3He}$, ${\\rm ^6Li}$, and\n${\\rm ^7Li}$).  Such processes may significantly change the prediction\nof the standard BBN scenario and, consequently, resultant abundances of\nlight elements may conflict with observations.  Furthermore, the\nelectromagnetic energy injection causes distortion of the CMB spectrum.\nSince the observation~\\cite{FIRAS} shows that this distortion is quite\nsmall, we can constrain the abundance of $X$.  Finally, if the lifetime\nis very long, the spectrum of neutrinos and photons produced by the\ndecay of $X$ are not thermalized and may be directly observed.\n\nThe effects of the long-lived particles on BBN were well studied for\nradiative decay~\\cite{BBNwX_OLD, KMrad,Holtmann:1998gd,Rad_recent} and\nfor hadronic decay~\\cite{Dominguez:1987,\nReno:1987qw,HadronicDecay,Kohri:2001jx,KKM04,Kohri:2005wn,Jedamzik:2006xz}\nand stringent constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X$ were\nobtained. However, when $X$ mainly decays into neutrinos, it is expected\nthat the constraints become much weaker because of weakness of\ninteractions between neutrinos and other standard model particles.  The\nspecific case where a sneutrino mainly decays into a gravitino and a\nneutrino has been already discussed in\n\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs,FenSuTak,Kanzaki:2006hm}.  Such a scenario is\nrealized when the sneutrino is the next lightest superparticle (NLSP)\nwhile the gravitino is the lightest superparticle (LSP).\\footnote\n%%\n{For the case that the gravitino is the the NLSP and that sneutrino is\n  the LSP, see also \\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}.}\n%%\nIn such a case, interaction of $X$ (i.e., sneutrino) is well-known,\nand it is found that BBN provides the most stringent constraint.\n\nHowever, there are other possibilities of having long-lived massive\nparticles which dominantly decay into  neutrinos.  For example, if the\nLSP is axino ($\\tilde{a}$) and the NLSP is sneutrino, dominant \ndecay process of the\nsneutrino ($=X$) is $\\tilde{\\nu}\\to\\nu+\\tilde{a}$.  \nDecay rate of this process\ndepends on the properties of axion supermultiplet.  Thus, in general,\nproperties of $X$ (i.e., lifetime, hadronic branching ratio, and so\non) is model-dependent.  Consequently, the most stringent bound may not\nbe from BBN.  For example, high energy neutrinos emitted in the $X$\nparticle decay was considered in \\cite{Gondolo:1991rn} where the upper\nbounds on the $X$ abundance were obtained from nucleon-decay detectors\nand Fly's Eye air shower array.\n%Neutrino emission from gravitinos at BBN epoch was studied in\n%Ref.~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs} and it was shown that electrons and\n%positrons produced via scattering off background neutrinos induce\n%electromagnetic showers which significantly affect BBN.  Moreover, the\n%emitted high energy neutrinos scatter off the background leptons\n%($\\nu$, $e^{\\pm}$) and produce charged pions. Pions emitted at $\\sim\n%1$~sec increases $p$-$n$ ratio and hence increases $^4$He abundance.\n%However, this effect was not taken into account\n%in~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}\n\nIn this paper, we derive general cosmological constraints on scenarios\nin which there exists a long-lived massive particle which dominantly\ndecays into a neutrino (and something else).  We treat the lifetime and\nhadronic branching ratio of the long-lived particle as free\nparameters.  In this case, in fact, the constraint from the main decay\nmode is quite weak, and other subdominant decay channel which contain\nelectronic and hadronic particles may be\nimportant~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}.  In our analysis, we take into\naccount both of these decay channels and discuss various cosmological\nconstraints.\n%In fact, when the $X$ particles mainly decay into neutrinos, \n%it is also possible for $X$ to decay into $SU(2)$ partners, i.e., \n%charged leptons with some branching ratio $B_X$. \n%Since $B_X$ is very model-dependent, we set \n%$B_X=10^{-3}, 10^{-6}$ as the representative values \n%throughout this paper. \n\nOrganization of this paper is as followis.  In Section \\ref{sec:bbn},\nwe discuss BBN constraints.  In Section \\ref{sec:cmb}, constraints\nfrom CMB is considered.  Then in Section \\ref{sec:diffuse}, we study\nconstraints from diffuse neutrino and photon.  Section\n\\ref{sec:conclusion} is devoted for conclusion.\n\n\\section{BBN Constraints}\n\\label{sec:bbn}\n\nBefore going into the main subject of this section, which is the\nconstraints from the BBN, let us first summarize the properties of the\nlong-lived heavy particle $X$ which mainly decays into a neutrino (and\nsome other weakly interacting particle).  In our study, we assume that\n$X$ mainly decays as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n X \\rightarrow \\nu + Y,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $Y$ is an invisible particle which is very weakly interacting so\nthat it does not cause any subsequent scattering with background\nparticles.  One of the well-motivated examples is the case where the\nsneutrino is the NLSP while gravitino (or axino) is the LSP.  (Then,\n$X$ is the sneutrino and $Y$ is the gravitino or axino.)  In addition,\nfor concreteness, we assume that the final-state neutrino is electron\nneutrino.  (We note here that we have checked that the constraints on\nthe properties of $X$ are not sensitive to the flavor of the\nfinal-state neutrino.)\n\nEven though the dominant decay mode is the two-body process, one\nshould keep in mind that decay chennels with three- and/or four-body\nfinal state should also exist since the neutrino as well as $X$ and/or\n$Y$ couple to $Z$- and $W$-bosons.  The emitted (real or virtual) weak\nbosons subsequently decay into quarks and leptons.  With this type of\nthree- and/or four-body decay processes, energetic quarks and charged\nleptons are produced.\n\nIf the decays of $X$ occur during or after BBN, the standard-model\nparticles emitted in the decay can affect the abundances of primordial\nlight elements.  First the high energy neutrinos emitted in the main\ndecay mode (two-body decay) scatter off the background leptons and\nproduce charged leptons ($e^{\\pm}$, $\\mu^{\\pm}$) and charged\npions. The former induce electromagnetic showers which destroy light\nelements, and the latter change the $n$-$p$ ratio through nucleon and\npion interactions.  Second $X$ decays into electromagnetic and\nhadronic particles via the three- and/or four-body decay modes with\nsmall branching ratio $B_X$.  Such processes directly induce\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers and change the abundances of\nlight elements~\\cite{KKM04}.\n\n\\subsection{Two-body Decay}\n\nFirst, we discuss effects of the dominant decay process $X\\to Y+\\nu_e$.\nWe presume that $Y$ produced in the decay is a very weakly interacting\nparticle, and that it is irrelevant for BBN.  Neutrino, however, may\naffect abundances of light elements.  The emitted energetic neutrinos\nscatter off background leptons via weak interaction and several\nkinds of particles may be pair-produced.\n\nFirst, charged leptons may be produced via the following\nprocesses:\\footnote\n%%\n{Neutrinos may also scatter off the background electron and positron.\n  However, since the photo-dissociation processes become important\n  when the cosmic temperature becomes much lower than $1\\ {\\rm MeV}$.\n  At such temperature, number densities of electron and positron are\n  exremely suppressed, and hence the scattering processes with\n  electron and positron are irrelevant for the production of charged\n  leptons. }\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\nu_i+\\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&e^{-}+e^{+}\n  \\label{nunu2ee}\\\\\n \\nu_i+\\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\mu^{-}+\\mu^{+}\n  \\\\\n \\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_{e,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\mu^{-}+e^{+}\n  \\\\\n \\nu_e+\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&e^{-}+\\mu^{+}\n  \\label{nunu2emu}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nwhere $i=e,\\mu,\\tau$ is flavor index, and the subscript ``BG'' is for\nbackground particles.  The muons emitted in the above processes quickly\ndecay into electrons and neutrinos.  Thus, the above processes produce\nenergetic electrons and positrons which cause electromagnetic cascade.\nEnergetic photons in the cascade induce photo-dissociation processes\nof light elements.  Effects of these processes have been already\nstudied in~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}.\n\nAnother possible effect is due to the production of pion pairs.\nHigh energy neutrinos scatter off the background neutrinos \nand electrons (positrons) and produce pions as\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\pi^{-}+ \\pi^{+},\n  \\\\\n  \\nu_i + {e}^{\\pm}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\pi^{0}+ \\pi^{\\pm}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nThe nucleus-pion interaction rate is $\\sim 10^8 {\\rm sec}^{-1}\\times\n(T/{\\rm MeV})^3$ which is larger than the decay rate of the charged\npion $(\\sim 4\\times10^7 {\\rm sec}^{-1})$ for $T\\sim 1 {\\rm MeV}$.\nTherefore, the charged pions produced at $T\\sim1 {\\rm MeV}$ scatter\noff the background nuclei and change protons (neutrons) into neutrons\n(protons) via\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\pi^{-}+p&\\to&n+\\pi^{0},~n+\\gamma,\n        \\\\\n        \\pi^{+}+n&\\to&p+\\pi^{0},~p+\\gamma.\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nConsequently, $n/p$ ratio is increased, resulting in more ${}^4{\\rm\n  He}$.  Notice that, because of very short lifetime, the neutral\npions decay before they scatter off the background nuclei and hence\nthey are harmless.\n\nIn order to estimate effects of the high-energy-neutrino induced\nprocesses, we have numerically solved the Boltzmann equation describing\nthe time evolution of the high energy neutrino spectrum taking into\naccount of all the processes above.  Details of our calculation are\ngiven in~\\ref{app:Boltzmann}.\n\n\\subsection{Three and Four-body Decay}\n\nEven though the branching ratio for three and four-body decay\nprocesses are much smaller than 1, such decay processes are very\nimportant since colored and charged particles are directly emitted\nfrom these decay processes.  Energetic colored and charged particles\nmay significantly change the prediction of the standard BBN scenario.\nEffects of these particles are classified into\nthree categories: photo-dissociations, hadro-dissociations and\n$p\\leftrightarrow n$ conversion.\n\nIn order to study the effects of three- and four-body decay processes,\nit is important to obtain the spectra of quarks and leptons emitted by\nthe decay of $X$, which depends on the model.  In our analysis, we\nuse, up to normalization, those obtained in the case where $X$ is the\nsneutrino and $Y$ is the gravitino; in such a case, the sneutrino may\ndecay into the gravitino, neutrino (or charged lepton), and $Z^{(*)}$\n(or $W^{(*)}$), and the produced (real or virtual) weak bosons\nsubsequently decay into quark- or lepton-pair.  (Here, $Z^{*}$ and\n$W^{*}$ denote virtual weak bosons.)  In order to perform our analysis\nas model-independent as possible, we treat that the branching ratio\nfor three- and four-body processes is a free parameter: we define\nbranching ratio $B_X$ as\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  B_X\\equiv\\frac{\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm 3~body})+\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm 4~body})}\n  {\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm all})},\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\Gamma$ is decay width.  For the study of the effects of\nphoto-dissociation processes and CMB spectral distortion, we also\ncalculate averaged ``visible energy'' emitted from one $X$:\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        E_{\\rm vis}=B_X\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle$ are averaged energy carried away by\ncharged particles and photons in three and four-decay modes.  The\nenergy distributions of photons, neutrinos, leptons and nucleons\nproduced by the decay of $X$ are calculated by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations with the PYTHIA package \\cite{Sjostrand:2000wi}.  In\nFigs.\\ \\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2}-\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e5}, we plot the\nspectra of photons and leptons ($e^+ + e^-$), respectively.  From\nthese distributions we calculate the averaged energy and obtain\n$\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle = 25.3, 146, 821$ and $5630\\ {\\rm GeV}$\nfor $m_X=10^2,10^3,10^4$ and $10^5\\ {\\rm GeV}$, respectively.  Here,\n$m_X$ is the mass of $X$.  $E_{\\rm vis}$ is much smaller than $m_X$\nsince we are interested in the case where $B_X\\ll 1$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m2.ps}\n                \\caption{Spectrum of $e^+ + e^-$ (solid line) and \n                photon (dashed line) with $m_X=10^2{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e2}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m3.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except\n                 $m_X=10^3{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e3}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m4.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except \n                $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e4}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m5.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except \n                $m_X=10^5{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e5}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nPhoto-dissociation processes are induced by energetic photons in\nelectromagnetic shower which is caused by charged particles and/or\nphotons emitted from $X$.  With given background temperature, the\ndistribution function of energetic photons depends on total amount of\nenergy injected by particles with electromagnetic interaction, and is\ninsensitive to the shape of energy spectrum of primary particles.  Thus,\nonce $E_{\\rm vis}$ is obtained, the energy distribution of energetic\nphotons in the electromagnetic shower can be obtained.  Then,\nphoto-dissociation rates are obtained by convoluting energy distribution\nfunction and cross sections of photo-dissociation reactions.  For\ndetails of our treatment of photo-dissociation processes,\nsee~\\cite{KMrad}.\n\nFor the study of hadro-dissociation processes, it is necessary to\nobtain energy distributions of (primary) hadrons which are produced\nafter the hadronization of quarks emitted from $X$.  We have\ncalculated the spectra of $p$ and $n$ by using PYTHIA.  These hadrons\ncause hadronic shower and induced hadro-dissociation processes.  In\nour analysis, in addition, we have also calculated the number of\ncharged pions produced by the decay of $X$.  Such charged pions,\nprotons and neutrons become the source of $p\\leftrightarrow n$\nconversion process, which changes the number of ${}^4{\\rm\n  He}$~\\cite{Reno:1987qw,Kohri:2001jx}.\\footnote\n%%\n{Here we have neglected the effects of Kaons\nto the $p\\leftrightarrow n$ conversion, according to the\ndiscussion in~\\cite{KKM04}.}\n%%\nOnce the spectra of hadrons are\nobtained, effects of hadro-dissociation  and $p\\leftrightarrow n$\nconversion are studied with the procedure given in \\cite{KKM04}.\n\n\\subsection{Numerical Results}\n\nIn our analysis, we have followed the evolutions of the number densities\nof the light elements.  For this purpose, we have modified the Kawano\ncode \\cite{Kawano:1992ua} including photo- and hadro-dissociation\nprocesses.\n%For details of our calculations, see~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}. \n%As for observational constraints on the light elements, \n%we use the same constraints as~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}except \n%${}^3{\\rm He}$.\n%Precise observational determinations of ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ are only possible within our galaxy.\n%The ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ abundance can decrease or increase after the BBN\n%due to galactic and stellar chemical evolution.\n%Therefore, the ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ in itself can not be solely used for a constraint.\n%Instead we adopt the ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ ratio.\n%D is produced exclusively in the BBN and always destroyed (is burned into ${}^3{\\rm He}$) \n%in stars due to its small binding energy.\n%${}^3{\\rm He}$ may be destroyed or produced.\n%Therefore, ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ monotonically increases with time \n%since ${}^3{\\rm He}$ is much more difficult to destroy than D. \n%When we adopt Protosolar Cloud data~\\cite{2003SSRv..106....3G}, ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ is given by\n%%%\n%\\begin{eqnarray}\n%       ({}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D})_p < 1.37~~~(2\\sigma).\n%\\end{eqnarray}\n%%%     \nAs observational constraints on the primordial\nabundances of light elements, we adopt those used in\n\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm} except for $Y_{\\rm p}$ and $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm\nD})_{\\rm p}$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  (n_{\\rm D}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm p} &=& (2.82\\pm 0.26) \\times 10^{-5},\n  \\\\\n   (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.83+0.27,\n%   (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.13}\n%  (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.59 \\pm 0.27,\n  \\\\\n   Y_{\\rm p} &=& 0.2516 \\pm 0.0040,\n%  Y_{\\rm p} &=& 0.250 \\pm 0.004,\n  \\\\\n  \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm ^7Li}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm p} &=& -9.63 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.3.\n  \\\\\n  (n_{\\rm ^6Li}/n_{\\rm ^7Li})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.046\\pm 0.022 + 0.084,\n  \\label{Li6/Li7}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the subscript ``p'' is for primordial value (just after BBN),\nand $Y_{\\rm p}$ is the primordial mass fraction of ${\\rm ^4He}$. For\nthe center value of $Y_{\\rm p}$, we have adopted the value\nreported in \\cite{Izotov:2007ed} in which the authors used new data of\nHeI emissivities,\\footnote\n%%\n{See also the other recent value of $Y_{\\rm p}$ reported in\n\\cite{Peimbert:2007vm} where the authors adopted larger errors\n(0.0028) than that of \\cite{Izotov:2007ed}.}\n%%\nand conservatively added a larger error (= $0.0040$) as discussed in\n\\cite{Fukugita:2006xy}.  For $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p}$, we\nhave adopted most newly-reported values of D and $^{3}$He abundances\nobserved in protosolar clouds~\\cite{GG03}, $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm\n  H})_{\\rm PSC} = (1.66 \\pm 0.06) \\times 10^{-5}$ and $(n_{\\rm\n  D}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm PSC} = (2.00 \\pm 0.35) \\times 10^{-5}$, where the\nsubscript ``PSC'' means a value in the protosolar cloud.  (For the\nimportance of the upper bounds on $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p}$,\nsee~\\cite{Sigl:1995kk,KKM04}.)\n\nWe parameterize the primordial abundance of $X$ by yield variable $Y_X$\nwhich is defined as the ratio of number density and \ntotal entropy density at ($t \\ll \\tau_X$);\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        Y_X\\equiv\\left[\\frac{n_X}{s}\\right]_{t\\ll \\tau_X},\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nwhere $\\tau_X$ is the lifetime of $X$.  If $Y_X$ is too large,\nabundances of light elements are too much affected to be consistent\nwith the observations.  Thus, we can derive upper bound on $Y_X$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E2Bm3.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=100{\\rm GeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-3}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E2Bm3}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E3Bm3.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=1{\\rm TeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-3}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E3Bm3}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E4Bm3.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=10{\\rm TeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-3}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E4Bm3}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E2Bm6.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=100{\\rm GeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-6}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E2Bm6}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E3Bm6.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=1{\\rm TeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-6}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E3Bm6}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{BbnNu_E4Bm6.ps}\n        \\caption{BBN constraints on $\\tau_X$ vs. $m_XY_X$ plane.\n        Here, we take $m_X=10{\\rm TeV}$ and $B_X=10^{-6}$.}\n        \\label{fig:BbnNu_E4Bm6}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nIn Figs.\\ \\ref{fig:BbnNu_E2Bm3}-\\ref{fig:BbnNu_E4Bm6}, we show BBN\nconstraints on $\\tau_X$ and $m_XY_X$ for $B_X=10^{-3}$ and\n$B_X=10^{-6}$; we found that constraints with $B_X=0$ is almost same as\nthat with $B_X=10^{-6}$.\n\nAs one can see from these figures, the most important constraint comes\nfrom overproduction of ${}^4{\\rm He}$ when $\\tau_X\\lesssim10^2{\\rm\n  sec}$.  Since protons are more abundant than neutrons, a significant\namount of proton may be converted to neutron through nucleus-pion\ninteraction (and nucleon-nuclen interactions for relatively large\n$B_{X}$) and consequently ${}^4{\\rm He}$ is overproduced.  When\n$10^2{\\rm sec}\\lesssim \\tau_X \\lesssim 10^7{\\rm sec}$, the background\n${}^4{\\rm He}$ (which we call $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$) is effectively\ndissociated by the energetic hadrons produced in the hadronic shower.\nIn this case, overproduction of D may occur as a result of\nhadro-dissociation of $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.  In addition, energetic T and\n${}^3{\\rm He}$ are also produced and they synthesize $^6$Li through\nthe ${}^6{\\rm Li}$ via ${\\rm T}+\\alpha_{\\rm BG}\\to {}^6{\\rm Li}+n$ and\n${}^3{\\rm He}+\\alpha_{\\rm BG}\\to {}^6{\\rm Li}+p$.  When\n$\\tau_X\\gtrsim10^7{\\rm sec}$, the energetic hadrons are stopped by the\nscattering processes with background electrons, and hence the effects\nof hadro-dissociation become less efficient than those of the\nphoto-dissociation.  In particular, the energetic photons produced in\nthe electromagnetic shower destroy $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.  In this case,\noverproduction of D and ${}^3{\\rm He}$ occurs as a result of\nphoto-dissociation of $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.\n\nThe constraints on $m_X Y_X$ depend on $m_X$ in a non-trivial way.  The\ncontraint coming from the photo-dissociation caused by the two-body\ndecay becomes stringent as $m_X$ increases because neutrinos emitted in\ntwo-body decay have higher energy and scatter off the background\nneutrinos with larger rate. On the other hand, the rates of the\nhadro-dissociation and photo-disocciation caused by the three- and\nfour-body decay depend only on $E_{\\rm vis} Y_X$ and hence the\nconstraints on $m_XY_X$ become slightly milder as $m_X$\nincreses.  The constraint from $n \\leftrightarrow p$ conversion becomes\nweaker as $m_X$ increases. This is because the charged pion production\nis roughly determined by $Y_X$ for the three- and four-decay.\n\n\nSo far, we have shown the results for the case where the primary\nneutrino is electron-type.  However, we have checked that the BBN\nconstraints are almost unchanged even if $X$ decays into muon- or\ntau-neutrino (and $Y$). \n\n\\section{CMB Constraints}\n\\label{sec:cmb}\n\nCMB also imposes constraints on the decays of $X$.\nCOBE observations show that CMB spectrum is almost perfect \nblackbody~\\cite{FIRAS}.\nTherefore any exotic energy injections that cause distortions \nin the spectrum of CMB are stringently \nconstrained~\\cite{Silk:1983hj,Kawasaki:1985ff,Hu:1993gc}.\nWhen the photons are emitted before redshift  $z\\sim 10^7$, \nthey are thermalized by Compton scattering, double Compton \nscattering and bremsstrahlung, and no spectral distortion \ntakes place.\nHowever, at  $z \\lesssim 10^7$ only Compton scattering is efficient.\nSince the Compton scattering does not change the total number of \nphotons, the resultant spectrum becomes a Bose-Einstein \ndistribution with a finite chemical potential $\\mu$, \nregardless of the detail of the injection.\nFor the case of massive particle decay, \nthe number density of injected photons is negligible compared \nwith that in the background.\nTherefore, the spectral distortions are determined by the fraction \nof the energy release, $\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma/\\rho_\\gamma$.  \nThen, for small $\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma/\\rho_\\gamma$ \nthe chemical potential of the photon spectrum is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\mu \n%  \\simeq \n%  \\frac{1}{2.143}\\left[3\\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}\n%\t\t  -4\\frac{\\Delta n_\\gamma}{n_\\gamma}\\right]\n \\simeq\\frac{1}{0.714}\\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}.\n        \\label{mu_energy_relation}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\n%where $\\Delta n_{\\gamma}/n_{\\gamma}$ is the fraction of the \n%injected photon number.\n\nAs we have discussed, there are two types of processes which contribute\nto the electromagnetic energy injection ($\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma$) in the\npresent scenario.  One is the two-body decay process: the high energy\nprimary neutrinos emitted by $X$ scatter off the background neutrinos\nand create charged leptons whose energy is finally converted to the\nenergy of radiation.  The other is the three- and four-body decay\nprocesses by which quarks and charged leptons are produced.  In our\nanalysis, we have taken into account both of these contributions.\n\n%There are two processes which contribute to the electromagnetic \n%energy injection ($\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma$) in the present scenario.\n%One is the contribution from two-body decay of $X$.\n%The massive long-lived particle $X$ is presumed to decay mainly to an \n%invisible particle ($Y$) and a neutrino.\n%The high energy neutrinos emitted in the decay scatter off \n%background neutrinos and create lepton pairs \n%whose  energy is finally converted to the photon energy.\n%The other is from three and four-body decay of $X$.\n%In our case, three and four-body decays of $X$ are $X\\to Y+\\nu+Z(Z^*)$ and \n%$X\\to Y+l+W(W^*)$ where $l$ is charged lepton.\n%These $Z(Z^*)$ and $W(W^*)$ decay to various particles and \n%contribute to the electro-magnetic energy.\n\n\\subsection{Three and four-body Decay}\n\nThere are two quantities which are required to calculate \nthe electromagnetic energy injection:\nbranching ratio $B_X$ and the averaged energy $\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle$.\n\nWe follow the treatment of~\\cite{Hu:1993gc} for the case of \nthree and four-body decays.\nUsing the fact that $X$\ndecays exponentially in time with lifetime \n$\\tau_X$, we obtain\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}\n  =\\frac{\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle}{2.701T(t_{\\rm eff})}\n  \\frac{n_X}{n_\\gamma}B_X ,\n  \\label{energy_ratio}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $T(t)$ is the CMB temperature  and \n$n_X$ is the number density of $X$ before decay.\nHere $t_{\\rm eff} = \\left[\\Gamma(1+\\beta)\\right]^{1/\\beta}\\tau_X$\nfor time-temperature relation $T\\propto t^{-\\beta}$,\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the gamma function. \n\nFrom Eqs.~(\\ref{mu_energy_relation}) and (\\ref{energy_ratio}), \nwe find that the chemical potential is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\mu\\simeq4.00\\times10^2\n        \\left(\\frac{\\tau_X}{1{\\rm sec}}\\right)^{1/2}\n        \\left(\\frac{\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle}{1{\\rm GeV}}\\right)\n        B_X\\frac{n_X}{n_\\gamma}.\n        \\label{mu_decay}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nWe have assumed here that we are in the radiation dominated \nepoch where $T\\propto t^{-1/2}$.\nNote that, however, photon number changing processes \n(double Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung) become \nincreasingly efficient as the photon frequency decreases.\nThis means the spectrum becomes blackbody at low frequencies.\nThe photons with low frequencies produced by the photon-number\nchanging processes are transferred to higher frequencies \nby inverse Compton scattering and the chemical potential \ndecreases in time.  \nFor a low $\\Omega_b h^2$ universe suggested by the\nBBN~\\cite{Steigman:2005uz} and WMAP~\\cite{Spergel:2006hy}\n(where, in this paper, $\\Omega_b$ denotes the density parameter\nof baryon, and $h$ is the Hubble constant in units of\n$100\\ {\\rm km/sec/Mpc}$), double\nCompton scattering dominates the thermalization process.

However, the\nemitted ultra-relativistic particles (neutrino and $Y$) contribute to\nthe total relativistic energy and could lead to a more stringent\nconstraint than that from spectral distortion, when branching ratio is\nsufficiently small.  Before recombination, the CMB angular power\nspectrum is sensitive to the change of the total relativistic energy\nthrough the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect~\\cite{Zentner:2001zr}.\nIn addition, too much relativistic energy affects the growth of large\nscale structure (LSS) since the epoch for the matter-radiation equality\nbecomes later.  The increase of the total relativistic energy is\nconventionally described by an effective number of light neutrino\nspecies $\\Delta N_\\nu$.

Here neutrinos produced\nwith energy $E$ are redshifted to the observed energy $E_0=E/(1+z)$ and\n$E$ is just half of the mass of $X$.  The source spectrum\n$dN_\\nu/dE_0$ is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\frac{dN_\\nu(E_0)}{dE_0} =f_i\\delta(E-E_0(1+z)),\n  \\label{neutrino_source}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $f_i$ is the fraction of the neutrino spacies $i=e, \\mu,\n\\tau$ emitted by the decay of $X$.  (Notice that $\\sum_{i} f_i=1$.)  We\nhave assumed that only electron neutrinos are produced in the decay\nprocess.  However, we should take the effects of neutrino oscillations\ninto account.  Neutrino oscillations can be described by six parameters:\ntwo independent mass differences $( \\Delta m^2_{12},\\Delta m^2_{23})$,\nthree mixing angles $(\\theta_{12},\\theta_{23},\\theta_{13})$ and a\nCP-violating phase $\\delta$.  A mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ is $\\sim\n45^\\circ$ from atmospheric neutrino experiments~\\cite{Ashie:2005ik}.\n%A mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ is approximately same as the\n%atmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{\\rm atom}$ and experimentally\n%$37^\\circ < \\theta_{\\rm atom} < 53^\\circ$~\\cite{Ashie:2005ik}.  The\n%value of $\\theta_{\\rm atom}$ that fits the data best is $45^\\circ$.  \nA mixing angle $\\theta_{12}$ is determined by solar neutrino experiments\nas $\\theta_{12} \\simeq 34^{\\circ}$~\\cite{Aharmim:2005gt}.  CHOOZ\nexperiment presented a mixing angle $\\theta_{13} <\n12^\\circ$~\\cite{Apollonio:2002gd}.  In our case, neutrino traveling\ndistance is very long and mass differences are irrelevant.\nCP-violating phase $\\delta$ enters the mixing matrix only in combination\nwith $\\sin\\theta_{13}$.  In a reasonable approximation, $f_e\\sim0.6$ and\n$f_\\mu\\sim f_\\tau\\sim0.2$.\n\nThe present\natmospheric neutrino $\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ data gives the upper bound\nof the differential flux of $\\nu_\\mu (\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu)$ neutrinos.  The\natmospheric neutrino has been observed by\nSuper-Kamiokande~\\cite{Ashie:2005ik} and AMANDA~\\cite{Geenen:2003gg}.\nFor observational flux of energy range $0.3-1.0\\times10^3~{\\rm GeV}$ we\nadopt the result in~\\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2006ay} where the atmospheric\nneutrino fluxes are estimated from the data on atmospheric neutrino\nevent rates measured by the Super-Kamiokande experiment.  For higher\nernergy range $1.3\\times10^3-3.0\\times10^5~{\\rm GeV}$ we use the\natmospheric neutrino spectrum derived from AMANDA. In\nFig.~\\ref{fig:neutrino_flux}, we show the atmospheric neutrino fluxes\nfrom the Super-Kamiokande and AMANDA experiments as well as the diffuse\nneutrino fluxes from the $X$ decay.\n\nFuthermore, the diffuse neutrino flux is also constrained from null\ndetection of the relic supernova $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux by\nSuper-Kamiokande. In~\\cite{Malek:2002ns}, the upperbound on\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux is obtained as $\\Phi_{\\bar{\\nu}_e}\\le\n1.2\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ above threshold of $ E_\\nu >\n19.3\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nWe require that the neutrino flux from $X$ decay should not exceed the\nobserved atmospheric $\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ flux and upperlimit of the\nrelic supernona $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux, which leads to the constraints on\nthe abundance of $X$ as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dif_neu}.  In the figure\nwe also show the constraint from relic supernova search only.  When\nlifetime is short, the constraint is very weak since the neutrinos get\nredshifted until the present and their energy becomes lower than the\n$20$~MeV. For intermediate lifetime, the constraints on the abundances\nof $X$ are determined by the relic supernova $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ search and\nthey are in proportion to $m_X$ because the diffuse $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux\nis determined by the number of injected neutrinos above threshold\nenergy, hence $Y_X$.  When lifetime is long, however, the constraints\nare determined by atmospheric neutrino fluxes.  Since the neutrino flux\nhas a peak at $\\sim m_X /(1+z_{d})$ ($z_d$: redshift at $t=\\tau_X$), the\nmaximum differential neutrino flux is propotional to $Y_X/m_X$. On the\nother hand, the observed differential neutrino flux is roughly\npropotional to $E^{-3}$ and hence $m_X^{-3}$ at $E\\sim m_X$. Therefore,\nthe constraint on $m_X Y_X$ depends on $m_X$ as $m_X m_X^{-3}/m_X^{-1}\n\\sim m_X^{-1}$.\nThis means the constraints become severe with larger mass as shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:dif_neu}.  Constraints for lifetimes longer than present\ntime $t_0$ scale by a factor $t_0/\\tau_X$ relative to the constraints at\n$t_0=\\tau_X$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{neutrino_flux.ps}\n  \\vspace{-1cm}\n                \n  \\caption{Atmospheric neutrino flux.

In calculating the diffuse\nphoton spectrum, we must consider primary photon spectrum which is not\nmonoenergetic.  In addition, we should also take account of the\nabsorption of gamma rays along the line of sight.  \n\nSince photons are produced through three- and four-body decays, their\nspectrum is not monochromatic unlike neutrino.  The energy distributions\nof photons, neutrinos, leptons and nucleons produced by the three- and\nfour-body decay of $X$ are shown in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2}-\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e5}.  The energy of\nproduced electrons and positrons is transferred to the background\nphotons through inverse Compton process.\n%Therefore the observed photon\n%flux is the sum of that produced directly by $X$-particle decay and\n%inverse Compton process.  \nIn calculating the photon flux, we have taken into account the photons\nproduced by the inverse Compton process as well as those from the\ncascade decay chain induced by the three- and four-body decay of $X$.\nThe latter effect becomes more important for high energy photons.\nHowever, since the inverse Compton process produces many soft photons,\nthe formar process becomes more significant for low energy photons.  The\ndetails of calculation of inverse Compton process are given\nin~\\ref{app:inv}.  Nucleons are also produce in the decay and they\nproduce photons through inverse Compton process or $\\beta$\ndecay. However, we neglect this effect since the number density of\nproduced nucleons is sufficiently small.  In Fig.~\\ref{fig:phot_spec},\nwe plot photon flux for $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{phot_spec.ps} \\caption{Photon\n   spectrum versus photon energy for $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.

At the eraly epochs absorption and scattering due to the\nbackground photons are important, whereas significant absorption by\ndiffuse IR-UV photons emitted from galaxies takes place at\nlater epochs.\n\nFirst let us consider the radiative processes due to the background\nphotons.  In the present case, the relevant processes are photon-photon\nscattering and photon pair creation~\\cite{1989ApJ...344..551Z}.  Then,\nphotons degrade their energy by producing electron-positron pairs or\ndividing their energy with the background photons.  The photon spectrum\nwas calculated in detail in~\\cite{Kribs:1996ac}. According\nto~\\cite{Kribs:1996ac} the present differential flux of photons is given\nby\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\frac{d\\Phi_\\gamma}{dE_0} &= &\n        \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int^{z_*}_0 dz\\frac{1}{H_0h(z)}\n        \\frac{Y_Xs_0}{\\tau_X}\\exp(-t/\\tau_X) \\nonumber \\\\\n         & & \\times \\int dE \\mathcal{L}_s(E_0(1+z),E,z)\n         \\mathcal{L}_i(E,z)B_X,\n         \\label{eq:photon_flux}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_i(E,z)$ is the number of photons per unit energy\nproduced both directly and by inverse Compton at $z$ for one $X$ decay,\nand $z_*( \\simeq 700)$ is the redshift at which the optical depth of\nhigh enrergy photons becomes $1$.  In addition,\n$\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ is the number of photons per unit energy in\nthe spectrum when photons with energy $E_1$ are produced by scattering\nof photons with energy $E_2$ at redshift $z$.  If there is no\nscattering, $\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ becomes $\\delta(E_1-E_2)$. (The\nconcrete expression of $\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ is found in\n\\cite{Kribs:1996ac}.)\n\nIn addition, $\\gamma$ rays with GeV to TeV energies are absorbed via\nelectron-positron pair production on diffuse background IR-UV photons\nwhich have been emitted by\ngalaxies~\\cite{Salamon:1997ac,Primack:2000xp,Stecker:2005qs}.  In this\npaper, we adopt the result of \\cite{Stecker:2005qs} which calculated the\noptical depth $\\tau_{\\rm IR}$ of the universe for $\\gamma$ rays having\nenergies from 4 GeV to 100 TeV at redshifts from 0 to 5.  (See Fig.~8 in\n\\cite{Stecker:2005qs}.)  Then the resultant photon spectrum is given by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:photon_flux}) multiplied by $e^{-\\tau_{\\rm IR}}$.  We\nneglect the secondary soft photons produced via\nelectron-positron pair production on diffuse background IR-UV photons,\nand only consider the attenuation of high energy photons. \n\n\n%These soft photons should make the constraint severer.  \n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:photon_flux}, we show the diffuse photon flux from the\nCOMPTEL \\cite{1996A&AS..120C.619K} and EGRET \\cite{1998ApJ...494..523S}\nobservations and decay of $X$, from which we obtain the upper limit on\nthe abundance of $X$ as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dif_phot}.  Compared with\nthe limit from the neutrino flux, the constraints from photon flux are\nalmost insensitive to $m_X$. This can be understood as follows.  The\ndifferential photon flux at the peak energy is roughly proportional to\n$Y_X/m_X$ from the same reasoning as the neutrino flux in\nSec.~\\ref{subsec:neutrino_flux}, while the observed one is proportional\nto $E^{-2} \\propto m_X^{-2}$. Thus, the constraint on $Y_X$ depends on $m_X$\nas $m_X^{-2}m_X \\sim m_X^{-1}$, which means that the limit on $m_X Y_X$\nis almost insensitive to $m_X$. \nFig.~\\ref{fig:dif_phot} shows that the constraints become less stringent\nwith larger $m_X$ when lifetime is long.  There are two reasons for this.\nOne is EGRET had observed up to $100{\\rm GeV}$.  When $m_X$ is large,\nthe present photon energy at which the flux becomes maximum  may exceed\nthe energy range of EGRET observation.  The other is higher energy photons are\nmore effectively absorbed by diffuse background photons.  \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{photon_flux.ps}\n  \\caption{Diffuse photon flux.

In this paper, a source of high energy photon is charged\nleptons and pions which are produced through scattering of high energy\nneutrinos off background leptons.  Therefore, we determine the time\nevolution of the distribution function of high energy neutrinos in order\nto investigate the photon spectrum.  In this appendix, we write down\nBoltzmann equations which determines the high energy neutrino spectrum.\nOur notation is the same as~\\cite{Moroi:1995fs}.\n\nThe high energy neutrinos ($\\nu$) produced in $X$ decay scatter off\nthe thermal neutrino ($\\nu_b$) in the background by the following processes;\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    \\nu_{i} + \\nu_{i,b} &\\rightarrow & \\nu_i + \\nu_i , \n     \\label{reaction:neu-neu1} \\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_i,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_j + \\bar{\\nu}_j ,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\nu_{j,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\nu_j,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{j,b} & \\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_j, \n     \\label{reaction:neu-neu2} \\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow & e^{-}  + e^{+},\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} & \\rightarrow & \\mu^{-}  + \\mu^{+}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere index $i$ and $j$ represent $e$, $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ with $i\\neq j$.\nAll the amplitude squared $|{\\cal M}|^2$ in these reactions take the\nfollowing form:\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    |{\\cal M}|^2 = 32G_F^2[ \n    a(pp')^2 + b(pq)^2 + c(pq')^2 + d m^2 (pp')] ,\n    \\label{amplitude}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $G_F \\simeq 1.17\\times 10^{-5}{\\rm GeV}^{-2}$ is the Fermi constant,\nthe coefficients $a$ -- $d$ depend on the individual reaction, $p$ and\n$p'$ are the initial momenta of high energy neutrino and background\nneutrino, $q$ and $q'$ are the final momenta, and $m$ represents the\nmass of the fermion the in final state. \nCoefficients for each processes are given in Table~\\ref{table:neutrino-neutrino}. \n%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%TABLE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%\n\\begin{table}\n%\n\\begin{center}\n%\n\\begin{tabular}{c|lccc} \\hline \\hline\n%\n{Process} &\n{~~a~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~b~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~c~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~d~~~~~~~~~} \\\\ \\hline\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\nu_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\nu_i$} &\n{~~2} &  {0} & {0} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_i$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {9} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_j + \\bar{\\nu}_j$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {1} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\nu_{j,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\nu_j$} &\n{~~1} &  {0} & {0} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{j,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_j$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {1} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow l_i^{-}  + l_i^{+}$} &\n{~~0} & {$(C_V-C_A)^2$} & {$(C_V+C_A+2)^2$} & {$(C_V-C_A)(C_V+C_A+2)$} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow l_j^{-}  + l_j^{+}$} &\n{~~0} & {$(C_V-C_A)^2$} & {$(C_V+C_A)^2$} & {$C^2_V-C^2_A$} \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n%\n\\end{tabular}\n%\n\\caption{Coefficients $a$ -- $d$ for each processes.

The twist is parameterized by variable\n$\\eta$. The fact that $z \\sim z + 2 \\pi R$ is periodic makes the twist\ndeformation physical.\n\nMelvin universes has a natural embedding in string theory\n\\cite{Dowker:1993bt,Dowker:1994up,Behrndt:1995si}. Simply embed\n(\\ref{twist}) in 11-dimensional supergravity. Reducing along $z$ gives\nrise to a background in type IIA string theory with a background of\nmagnetic RR 2-form field strength.\n\nAlong similar lines, one can embed (\\ref{twist}) in type IIA\nsupergravity and T-dualize along $z$. This gives rise to a background\nin type IIB string theory\n%\n\\beq ds^2 & = & -dt^2 + d \\vec x^2 + dr^2 + {r^2 d \\varphi^2 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} + {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} d\\tilde z^2 \\cr\nB & = & {\\eta r^2 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} d \\varphi \\wedge d \\tilde z \\cr\ne^{\\phi} & = & \\sqrt{1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2 r^2} \\cr\n\\tilde z &=& \\tilde z + 2 \\pi \\tilde R, \\qquad \\tilde R  = {\\alpha' \\over R} \\ ,  \\label{melvinbg}\n\\eeq\n%\nwith an axially symmetric magnetic NSNS 3-form field strength in the\nbackground. String theories in backgrounds like (\\ref{melvinbg}) are\nvery special in that the world sheet theory is exactly solvable\n\\cite{Russo:1994cv,Tseytlin:1994ei,Russo:1995tj,Tseytlin:1995fh,Russo:1995aj,Russo:1995ik}. Quantization\nof open strings in Melvin backgrounds have also been studied and was\nshown to be exactly solvable \\cite{Dudas:2001ux,Takayanagi:2001aj} as\nwell.\n\nEmbedding D-branes in Melvin universes can give rise to interesting\nfield theories in the decoupling limit. A D3-brane extended along $t$,\n$\\tilde z$, and two of the $\\vec x$ coordinates gives rise to a\nnon-local field theory known as the ``dipole'' theory\n\\cite{Bergman:2000cw,Bergman:2001rw}. Orienting the D3-brane to be\nextended along the $t$, $r$, $\\varphi$, and $\\tilde z$ coordinates, on\nthe other hand, gives rise to a non-commutative gauge theory with a\nnon-constant non-commutativity parameter\\footnote{The first explicit\nconstruction of models of this type is\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2002nr}.}\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. These\nare field theories, whose Lagrangian \\cite{Hashimoto:2005hy} is\nexpressed most naturally using the deformation quantization formula of\nKontsevich\\footnote{General construction of non-commutative field\ntheory on curved space-time with non-constant non-commutativity\nparameter, arising from D-branes in non-vanishing $H$ field\nbackground, and their relation to the deformation quantization formula\nof Kontsevich, was first discussed in \\cite{Cornalba:2001sm}.}\n\\cite{Kontsevich:1997vb}. Field theories arising as a decoupling\nlimits of various orientations of D-branes in Melvin and related\nclosed string backgrounds along these lines\\footnote{The S-dual NCOS theories with non-constant non-commutativity parameter was studied in  \\cite{Cai:2002sv,Cai:2006tda}.}  were tabulated and\nclassified in Table 1 of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.\\footnote{More\nrecently, a novel non-local field theory, not included in the\nclassification of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}, was discovered\n\\cite{Ganor:2006ub,Ganor:2007qh}.}\n\n\nTo show that the decoupled field theory is a non-commutative field\ntheory, the authors of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb} presented the following\narguments:\n%\n\\begin{itemize}\n%\n\\item The application of Seiberg-Witten formula\\footnote{The normalization of $B$ field is such that $B_{{\\rm Hashimoto-Thomas}}= 2 \\pi \\alpha' B_{{\\rm Seiberg-Witten}}$.} \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}\n%\n\\be (G + {\\theta \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'})^{\\mu \\nu} = [(g + B)_{\\mu \\nu}]^{-1}   \\label{swmap} \\ee\n%\nto the closed string background (\\ref{melvinbg}) gives the following open string metric and the non-commutativity parameter\n%\n\\beq G_{\\mu \\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu &=& -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d \\varphi^2 + d\nz^2 \\cr \\theta^{\\varphi z} & = & 2 \\pi \\alpha' \\eta \\\n \\label{openmetric} \\eeq\n%\nwhich are finite if $\\alpha'$ is scaled to zero keeping $\\Delta = \\alpha' \\eta$ fixed.\n\n\\item Solution of the classical equations of motion of an open string traveling freely on the D3-brane with angular momentum $J$ has a dipole structure whose size is given by\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}\n%\n\\be L = \\theta^{\\varphi z} J \\ . \\ee\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnother suggestive argument is the similarity between $\\alpha'\n\\rightarrow 0$ limit of critical string theory and the boundary\nPoisson sigma-model \\cite{Cattaneo:1999fm} as was pointed out, e.g.,\nin \\cite{Baulieu:2001fi}. As was emphasized in \\cite{Baulieu:2001fi},\nhowever, the two theories are not to be understood as being equivalent\nor continuously connected. This apparent similarity therefore does not\nconstitute a proof that the decoupled theory is a non-commutative\nfield theory.\n\nA physical criteria for non-commutativity is the Moyal-like phase\nfactor in scattering amplitudes.  Scattering amplitudes of open\nstrings ending on a D-brane can be computed along the lines reviewed\nin \\cite{Hashimoto:1996bf}.  In the case of the constant\nnon-commutativity parameter, one can show very explicitly that\n%\n\\be \\langle e^{i p^1 x(\\tau_1)} e^{i p^2 x(\\tau_2)} \\ldots e^{i p^n x(\\tau_n)}\\rangle_{G,\\theta} = e^{-{i \\over 2} \\sum_{n > m} p_i^n \\theta^{ij} p_j^m \\epsilon(\\tau_n-\\tau_m)}\n\\langle e^{i p^1 x(\\tau_1)} e^{i p^2 x(\\tau_2)} \\ldots e^{i p^n x(\\tau_n)}\\rangle_{G,\\theta=0}\\label{master}\\ee\n%\nwhich implies that the scattering amplitudes receive corrections in\nthe form of the Moyal phase factor\n\\cite{Chu:1998qz,Schomerus:1999ug,Seiberg:1999vs}. The goal of this\narticle is to derive the analogous statement (\\ref{melvinMoyal}) for\nthe model of \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. Once\n(\\ref{melvinMoyal}) is established in polar coordinates, the\nconnection to Kontsevich formula follows from performing a change of\ncoordinates to the rectangular coordinate system and a non-local field\nredefinition as is described in\n\\cite{Cerchiai:2003yu,Hashimoto:2005hy}.\n\nA useful first step in this exercise is to reproduce the master\nrelation (\\ref{master}) in a slightly different formalism than what\nwas used in \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}.  Let us begin by constructing the\nclosed string background as follows. Start with flat space\n%\n\\be ds^2 = dy'^2 + d\\tilde z^2 \\ ,  \\ee\n%\nwhere $y$ and $\\tilde z$ are compactified with period $L = 2 \\pi R$. Then,\n%\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[{\\bf I}]\nT-dualize along the $z$ direction so that the metric becomes \n%\n\\be ds^2 = dy'^2 + d z^2 \\ .  \\ee\n%\n%\n\\item[{\\bf II}] Twist by shifting the coordinates $y' = y + \\eta z$\n%\n\\be ds^2 = (dy+ \\eta dz)^2 + d z^2 \\ . \\ee\n%\n\\item[{\\bf III}] T-dualize on $z$ so that\n%\n\\be ds^2 = {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2}(dy^2 + d \\tilde z^2), \\qquad B = {\\eta \\over 1 + \\eta^2} dy \\wedge d \\tilde z \\ . \\ee\n%\nThe open string metric associated to this background is\n%\n\\be G_{\\mu \\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = dy^2 + d \\tilde z^2, \\qquad \\theta^{y \\tilde z} = 2 \\pi \\Delta^2 \\ee\n%\nif we scale\n%\n\\be \\Delta^2 = \\alpha' \\eta \\ . \\ee\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n%\nThe transformation of the coordinates and the orientation of the branes are illustrated in figure \\ref{figa}.  This sequence of dualities was referred to as the ``Melvin shift twist'' in \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics{coordinates}}\n\\caption{In {\\bf I} and {\\bf II}, the thick line denotes a D2-brane,\nand the dotted line is the minimum energy configuration of the open\nstrings ending on the D2-branes.  The {\\bf I} and {\\bf II} are related\nby coordinate transformation $y' = y + \\eta z$.  {\\bf III} is the\nT-dual of {\\bf II}, and the shaded region in {\\bf III} denotes a\nD3-brane.\\label{figa}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe approach of \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs} was to work directly in the\nduality frame {\\bf III}, but one can just as easily work in a\nframework which makes the T-duality between duality frame {\\bf II}\nand {\\bf III} manifest, by working with a sigma model of the form \n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1  d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + 2 \\eta \\partial_a y V_b + (1 + \\eta^2) V_a V_b\\right) + i \\epsilon^{ab} \\partial_a \\tilde z  V_b \\right]\\label{sig1}\\ee\n%\nwhere we have chosen to work in conformal gauge in Eucledian\nsignature. This action utilizes the Bushar's formulation of T-duality\n\\cite{Buscher:1987qj}. To see this more explicitly, consider integrating out the field $\\tilde z$. This imposes the constraint\n%\n\\be d V = 0 \\rightarrow V_a = \\partial_a z \\ee\n%\nwhich brings the action (\\ref{sig1}) into the form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + 2 \\eta \\partial_a y \\partial_b z + (1 + \\eta^2) \\partial_a z \\partial_b z \\right)  \\right]\\label{sig2}\\ee\n%\nwhich is the sigma model for the duality frame {\\bf II}. On the other hand, integrating out $V$ first gives rise to a sigma model of the form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[\\left( {1 \\over 1 + \\eta^2}\\right) {1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y \\partial_b y + \\partial_a \\tilde z \\partial_b \\tilde z \\right)  + i \\left({\\eta \\over 1 + \\eta^2}\\right)\\epsilon^{ab} \\partial_a y \\partial_b \\tilde z \\right]\\label{sig3}\\ee\n%\nwhich is the string action for the duality frame {\\bf III}.\n\nIn extracting non-commutative gauge theory as a decoupling limit, we\nare interested in embedding a D-brane extended along the $y$ and\n$\\tilde z$ coordinates in the duality frame {\\bf III}.  We must\ntherefore take the sigma model to be defined on a Riemann surface with\none boundary, which we take to be the upper half plane.  It is also\nnecessary to impose the appropriate boundary condition for all of the\nworld sheet fields. We impose the boundary condition which is free\nalong the $y$ direction and Dirichlet along the $z$ direction:\n%\n\\be \\left.\\partial_n y(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)+ \\eta V_n(\\sigma,\\bar\\sigma)\\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} = 0 \\label{bc0} \\ , \\ee\n\\be \\left. V_t \\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma}  = \\left. \\partial_t z \\right|_{\\partial \\Sigma} = 0 \\label{bc1} \\ . \\ee\n%\nUsing the equation of motion from the variation of $V_a$ field\n%\n\\be \\eta \\partial_b y + (1 + \\eta^2) V_b + i \\epsilon_{ab} \\partial_a \\tilde z = 0 \\, \\label{bc2}\\ee\n%\nand (\\ref{bc1}), we infer \n%\n\\be  \\partial_n \\tilde z - i \\eta \\partial_t  y = 0 \\label{bc3}\\ .  \\ee\n%\nThe boundary conditions (\\ref{bc0}) and (\\ref{bc3}) are precisely the\nboundary condition imposed in the analysis of \\cite{Seiberg:1999vs}.\n\nIn order to complete the derivation of (\\ref{master}), we add a source term\n%\n\\be e^{- S_{source}} = \\prod_n e^{i k_{yn} y(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n,\\bar\\sigma_n)}  =\ne^{\\sum_n (i k_{yn} y(\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n) + i k_{zn} \\tilde z (\\sigma_n,\\bar \\sigma_n))} \\ee\n%\nto the action (\\ref{sig1}).  Integrating out the $V$ fields and\nbringing the sigma model (\\ref{sig1}) into duality frame {\\bf III}\nwould lead to identical computation as what was described in\n\\cite{Seiberg:1999vs} to derive (\\ref{master}).  We will show below\nthat the same conclusion can be reached using a slightly different\nargument which turns out to easily generalize to the case of Melvin\ndeformed theories \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}.\n\nThe approach we take here is to go to the duality frame {\\bf I}. This brings the sigma model (\\ref{sig1}) to a simpler form\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a y' \\partial_b y' +  \\partial_a z \\partial_b z\\right)  \\right]\\label{sig4}\\ . \\ee\n%\nThe $\\tilde z$ field in the vertex operator now plays the role of a\ndisorder operator of the dual field $z$. It has the effect of shifting\nthe Dirichlet boundary condition, incorporating the fact that strings\nare stretched along the $z$ direction in frames {\\bf I} and {\\bf\nII}.

We will\nconsider the simplest case of embedding (\\ref{melvinbg}) into bosonic\nstring theory. For the Melvin universe background (\\ref{melvinbg}), it\nis convenient to prepare a vertex operator that corresponds to\ntachyons in cylindrical basis\n%\n\\beq V(\\nu,m,\\vec k) &=&\n\\int d k_1 \\,  d k_2\\,  \\delta(\\nu^2 - k_1^2 - k_2^2) e^{i m \\theta} e^{i  k_1 x_1(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma) + k_2 x_2(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma) + \\vec k \\vec x(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)} \\cr\n& = & e^{i \\vec k \\vec x(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)} J_\\nu(r(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)) e^{i m \\varphi(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)}  \\label{polarV} \\eeq\n%\nwhere \n%\n\\be r^2 = x_1^2+x_2^2, \\qquad \\varphi = \\arg(x_1 + i x_2), \\qquad \\theta = \\arg(k_1 + i k_2) \\ . \\ee\n%\nAs long as $\\vec k^2 + \\nu^2$ are taken to satisfy the on-shell\ncondition of the tachyon, (\\ref{polarV}) is linear combination of\noperators of boundary conformal dimension 1, and must itself be an\noperator of boundary conformal dimension one. Such construction of\nvertex operator as a linear superposition is similar in spirit to what\nwas considered in \\cite{Liu:2002ft,Liu:2002kb}.\n%\n\\be S= {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\alpha'} \\int d \\sigma_1 d \\sigma_2 \\left[{1 \\over 2} \\delta^{ab} \\left( \\partial_a r \\partial_b r + r^2 \\partial_a \\varphi \\partial_b \\varphi + 2 \\eta r^2 \\partial_a \\varphi  V_b + (1 + \\eta^2 r^2) V_a V_b\\right) + i \\epsilon^{ab} \\partial_a \\tilde z  V_b \\right]\\label{melsig1}\\ee\n%\non the upper half plane.

It is still the case that $(\\varphi',z)$\nsector, for some fixed $r(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma)$, is non-interacting. We\nwill exploit this fact and do the path integral in the order where we\nintegrate over $\\varphi'$ and $z$ first.\n%\nThe two point function of $\\varphi'$ formally has the form\n%\n\\be \\langle \\varphi'(\\sigma_1, \\bar \\sigma_1)\\varphi'(\\sigma_2, \\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle = (\\partial r^2(\\sigma,\\bar \\sigma) \\partial)^{-1} \\ .  \\ee\n%\nThen, it follows that\n%\n\\be \\langle \\varphi'(\\sigma_1, \\bar \\sigma_1)\\partial^a \\tilde \\varphi'(\\sigma_2, \\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle = i \\epsilon^{ab} (\\partial^b)^{-1}  \n\\ee\n%\nfrom which it follows \n%\n\\be \\langle \\tilde \\varphi'(\\sigma_1,\\bar \\sigma_1) \\varphi'(\\sigma_2,\\bar \\sigma_2) \\rangle\n= - {1 \\over 2} \\alpha'  (\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) +\n\\log(\\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\sigma_2) -\n\\log(\\bar \\sigma_1- \\bar \\sigma_2) ) \\label{coor7} \\ee\n%\nin complete analogy with (\\ref{coor2}). The correlator (\\ref{coor7})\ntells us that while the field-field correlator $\\langle \\varphi' \\varphi'\n\\rangle$ is complicated and $r$ dependent, the field/disorder field\ncorrelator $\\langle \\tilde \\varphi' \\varphi' \\rangle$ stays simple and\ntopological.\n\nWe can then proceed to compute the analogue of (\\ref{OOcorr}) and\n(\\ref{OOope}) for the operator (\\ref{melvinO}) in the $(\\varphi',z)$\nsector.  While we do not explicitly compute the $\\langle \\tilde \\varphi'\n\\tilde \\varphi' \\rangle$ correlator which appear at order $\\eta^2$ in\n(\\ref{OOcorr}), it is clear that the boundary condition forces this\nterm to vanish as was the case in the earlier example.  The term of\norder $\\eta$ in the exponential can be made to take the Moyal-like\nform\n%\n\\be e^{{i \\over 2}  \\sum_{a < b} (2 \\pi \\Delta) (m_a k_{zb} - k_{za} m_b) \\epsilon(\\tau_b-\\tau_a)}  \\label{melvinMoyal}\\ee\n%\nwhich is finite in the scaling limit $\\alpha' \\rightarrow 0$ with\n%\n\\be \\eta = {\\Delta \\over \\alpha'} \\ee\n%\nkeeping $\\Delta$ finite. This is precisely the scaling considered in\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. The dependence on $r(\\sigma,\n\\bar \\sigma)$ drops out for this term of order $\\eta$, allowing us to\nfurther path integrate over this field trivially, with the only effect\nof $\\eta$ being the overall phase factor (\\ref{melvinMoyal}).  This\nestablishes that the decoupled theory of D-branes in Melvin universes\nconsidered in \\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy} has an\neffective dynamics which includes the Moyal-like phase factor\ninvolving the angular momentum quantum number $m$ and the momentum\n$k_z$. In Cartesian coordinates, this Moyal phase corresponds to a\nposition dependent non-commutativity\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb,Hashimoto:2005hy}. This analysis extends\nstraight forwardly to other simple models of position dependent\nnon-commutativity, such as\\footnote{Using the terminology of\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2004pb}.} the ``Melvin Null Twist''\n\\cite{Hashimoto:2002nr} and ``Null Melvin Twist''\n\\cite{Dolan:2002px}. It would be interesting to extend this analysis\nto superstrings and to consider the scattering of states other than\nthe open string tachyon.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n%\nWe would like to thank\n%\nI.~Ellwood and \nO.~Ganor\n%\nfor discussions.\n%\nThis work was supported in part by the DOE grant DE-FG02-95ER40896 and\nfunds from the University of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliography{melvin}\\bibliographystyle{utphys}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{document}\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is shown that the cross\nsections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower\nenergies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and\nCoulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low\nas 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for\nstudies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{25.60.-t, 25.70.-z, 25.70.De} \\keywords{Coulomb excitation,\ncross sections, unstable nuclei.} \\maketitle\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\nUnstable nuclei are often studied with reactions induced by\nsecondary radioactive beams. Examples of these reactions are elastic\nscattering, fragmentation and Coulomb excitation by heavy targets.\nCoulomb excitation is specially useful since the interaction\nmechanism is very well known \\cite{AW75}. It is the result of\nelectromagnetic interactions of a projectile ($Z_{P}$,$A_{P}$) with\na target ($Z_{T}$,$A_{T}$). One of the participating nuclei is\nexcited as it passes through the electromagnetic field of the other.\nHere we will only consider the excitation of the projectile as is of\ninterest in studies carried out in heavy ion facilities around the\nworld, e.g. LNS/Catania, NSCL/MSU, GSI, GANIL, RIKEN, etc. In\nCoulomb excitation a virtual photon with energy $E$ is absorbed by\nthe projectile. Because in pure Coulomb excitation the participating\nnuclei stay outside the range of the nuclear strong force, the\nexcitation cross section can be expressed in terms of the same\nmultipole matrix elements that characterize excited-state gamma-ray\ndecay, or the reduced transition probabilities,\n$B(\\pi\\lambda;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f})$. Hence, Coulomb excitation\namplitudes are strongly coupled with valuable nuclear structure\ninformation. Therefore, this mechanism has been used for many years\nto study the electromagnetic properties of low-lying nuclear\nstates~\\cite{AW75}.\n\nCoulomb excitation cross sections are large if the adiabacity parameter\nsatisfies the condition\n\\begin{equation}\n\\xi=\\omega_{fi}\\dfrac{a_{0}}{v}<1\\ , \\label{1.1}%\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $a_{0}$ is half \\ the distance of closest approach in a\nhead-on collision for a projectile velocity $v$, and\n$E_{x}=\\hbar\\omega_{fi}$ is the excitation energy. This adiabatic\ncut-off limits the possible excitation energies below 1-2 MeV in\nsub-barrier collisions. A possible way to overcome this limitation,\nand to excite high-lying states, is to use higher projectile\nenergies. In this case, the closest approach distance, at which the\nnuclei still interact only electromagnetically, is of order of the\nsum of the nuclear radii, $R=R_{P}+R_{T}$, where $P$ refers to the\nprojectile and $T$ to the target. For very high energies one has\nalso to take into account the Lorentz contraction\nof the interaction time by means of the Lorentz factor $\\gamma=(1-v^{2}%\n/c^{2})^{-1/2}$, with $c$ being the speed of light. For such collisions the\nadiabacity condition, Eq.~(\\ref{1.1}), becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\xi(R)=\\frac{\\omega_{fi}R}{\\gamma v}<1\\ . \\label{1.3}%\n\\end{equation}\nFrom this relation one obtains that for bombarding energies around\nand above 100 MeV/nucleon, states with energy up to 10-20 MeV can be\nreadily excited \\cite{WA79}.\n\nAn appropriate description of Coulomb excitation at intermediate\nenergies ($E_{lab}=10-500$ MeV/nucleon) has been described in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}. In this energy region neither the non-relativistic\nCoulomb excitation formalism described in ref. \\cite{AW75}, nor the\nrelativistic one formulated in refs. \\cite{WA79,BB85} are\nappropriate. This is discussed in details in ref. \\cite{Ber03} where\nit is shown that the correct values of the Coulomb excitation cross\nsections differ by up to 30-40\\% when compared to the\nnon-relativistic and relativistic treatments used to calculate\nexperimental observables (cross sections, gamma-ray angular\ndistributions, etc.).\n\nWe follow the formalism of ref. \\cite{Ber03} to calculate cross\nsections for Coulomb excitation from energies varying from 10 to 500\nMeV/nucleon. These are the energies where most radioactive beam\nfacilities are or will be operating around the world. The calculated\ncross sections will be of useful guide for future experiments. We\nalso compare the accurate calculations with those obtained by using\nsimple analytical formulas and test the regime of their validity.\n\nThe cross sections for the transition $J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f}$ in\nthe projectile are calculated using the equation  \\cite{Ber03}\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\frac{d\\sigma_{i\\rightarrow f}}{d\\Omega}}=\\frac{4\\pi^{2}Z_{T}^{2}e^{2}}%\n{\\hbar^{2}}\\;a^{2}\\epsilon^{4}\\;\\sum_{\\pi\\lambda\\mu}{\\dfrac{B(\\pi\\lambda\n,J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{f})}{(2\\lambda+1)^{3}}}\\;\\mid S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)\\mid\n^{2}\\ , \\label{cross_2}%\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\pi=E$ or $M$ stands for the electric or magnetic multipolarity, and\n\\begin{equation}\nB(\\pi\\lambda,J_{i}\\longrightarrow J_{f})=\\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1}\\ \\left\\vert\n\\left\\langle J_{f}\\left\\Vert \\mathbf{\\mathcal{M}}(\\pi\\lambda)\\right\\Vert\nJ_{i}\\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^{2}\\ \\label{reduced}%\n\\end{equation}\nare the reduced transition probabilities. In these equations, $\\epsilon\n=1/\\sin(\\Theta/2)$, with $\\Theta$ being the deflection angle, $a_{0}%\n={Z_{P}Z_{T}e^{2}/}m_{0}v^{2}$ and $a=a_{0}/\\gamma$. The complex\nfunctions $S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)$ are integrals along Coulomb\ntrajectories corrected for retardation. Their calculation and how\nthey relate to the non-relativistic and relativistic theories are\ndescribed in details in ref. \\cite{Ber03}. Here we will introduce\nanother comparison tool for the total cross section, which is\nobtained by integration of eq. \\ref{cross_2} over scattering angles.\nThe code COULINT \\cite{Ber03} was used to calculate the orbital\nintegrals $S(\\pi\\lambda,\\mu)$ and the cross sections of eq.\n\\ref{cross_2} (for more details, see ref. \\cite{Ber03}).\n\nUsing the theory described in ref. \\cite{BB85}, it is easy to show that\napproximate values of the cross sections for E1, E2, and M1 transitions can be\nobtained by means of the relations%\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_{E1}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{32\\pi^{2}}{9}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\hbar\nc}B\\left(  E1\\right)  \\left(  \\frac{c}{v}\\right)  ^{2}\\left[  \\xi K_{0}%\nK_{1}-\\frac{v^{2}\\xi^{2}}{2c^{2}}\\left(  K_{1}^{2}-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right]\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\sigma_{E2}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{75}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\left(\n\\hbar c\\right)  ^{3}}E_{x}^{3}B\\left(  E2\\right)  \\left(  \\frac{c}{v}\\right)\n^{4}\\left[  \\frac{2}{\\gamma^{2}}K_{1}^{2}+\\xi\\left(  1+\\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}%\n}\\right)  ^{2}K_{0}K_{1}-\\frac{v^{4}\\xi^{2}}{2c^{4}}\\left(  K_{1}^{2}%\n-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\\sigma_{M1}^{(app)}  &  =\\frac{32\\pi^{2}}{9}\\frac{Z_{T}^{2}\\alpha}{\\hbar\nc}B\\left(  M1\\right)  \\left[  \\xi K_{0}K_{1}-\\frac{\\xi^{2}}{2}\\left(\nK_{1}^{2}-K_{0}^{2}\\right)  \\right]  , \\label{approx}%\n\\end{align}\nwhere $K_{n}$ are the modified Bessel functions of the second order, as a\nfunction of $\\xi$ given by eq. \\ref{1.3}, with $R$ corrected for recoil by the\nmodification $R\\rightarrow R+\\pi a/2$ \\cite{WA79}.\n\nHere we will only consider the excitation of the lowest lying states\nin light and medium heavy nuclei. For nuclear masses $A<20$, the\nTUNL nuclear data evaluation web site was of great help \\cite{tunl}.\nThe electromagnetic transition rates at the TUNL database are given\nin Weisskopf units and are transformed to the appropriate\n$B(\\pi\\lambda,I_{i}\\rightarrow I_{f})$-values by means of the\nstandard Weisskopf relations $B_W(E1;J_{i}\\rightarrow\nJ_{gs})=0.06446A^{2/3}$\ne$^{2}$fm$^{2}$, $B_W(E2;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{gs})=0.05940A^{4/3}$ e$^{2}$%\nfm$^{4}$, and $B_W(M1;J_{i}\\rightarrow J_{gs})=1.79\\left(  e\\hbar/2m_{n}%\nc\\right)  ^{2}$. For comparison, a few medium mass nuclei, as well\nas a few stable nuclei, were included in the calculation. Other data\nwere taken from refs. \\cite{Mot95,Sch96,Gad03,Im04}.\n\nSome cases of nuclei far from the stability line are very\ninteresting and deserve further study, possibly using the method of\nCoulomb excitation. For example, it is well known that nuclei with\nopen shells tend to have $B(E2)$ values greater than 10 W.u.,\nwhereas nuclei with shell closure of neutrons or protons tend to\nhave distinctly smaller $B(E2)$ values. Typical examples of the\nlatter category are the doubly magic nuclei, $^{16}$O and $^{48}$Ca,\nwhich $B(E2)$ values are 3.17 and 1.58 W.u., respectively. According\nto an empirical formula adjusted to a global fit of the known\ntransition rates, the\nvalues of first excited $2^{+}$ level, $E_{2^{+}}$, and $B(E2;0^{+}%\n\\rightarrow2^{+})$ are related by \\cite{Ra88} ($E_{2^+}$ in keV)\n\\begin{equation}\nB(E2;0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+})=26\\frac{Z^{2}}{A^{2/3}E_{2^{+}}}\\text{ e}%\n^{2}\\text{fm}^{4}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nThe value of $B(E2)$ for $^{16}$C based on this formula is at least\none order of magnitude larger than what is observed experimentally\nin a Coulomb dissociation experiment \\cite{Im04}. The anomalously\nstrong hindrance of the $^{16}$C transition is not well explained\ntheoretically. This is just an example of the power of Coulomb\nexcitation as a tool to access the new physics inherent of poorly\nknown rare nuclear species.\n\nAnother example is the strong $E1$ transition in $^{11}$Be.\n$^{11}$Be is an archetype of a halo nucleus and exhibits the fastest\nknown dipole transition between bound states in nuclei. The $B(E1)$\ntransition strength between the ground and the only bound excited\nstate (at 0.32 MeV) was determined from lifetime measurements by\nMillener et al. to be 0.116 e$^{2}$fm$^{2}$ \\cite{Mi83}. However,\nCoulomb excitation experiments have obtained a much smaller value of\nthe $B(E1)$ which is still a matter of investigation\n\\cite{BCH95,Hus06,Cha07}. It is thus seems clear that predictions based on\ntraditional nuclear structure and reaction theory often yields\nresults in disagreement with experimental data. In spite of that,\nwhen proper corrections are accounted for (e.g. channel-coupling,\nnuclear excitation, relativistic corrections), Coulomb excitation of\nradioactive beams is a powerful complementary tool to investigate\nelectromagnetic properties of nuclei far from the stability line.\n\nIn Table 1 we compare our calculations with several experimentally\nobtained cross sections for Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei.\nThe units of energy are MeV, the laboratory energy is in\nMeV/nucleon, the B-values are in units of e$^{2}$ fm$^{2\\lambda}$,\nand the cross sections are in millibarns. The last two columns give\nthe calculated cross sections obtained by using eqs. \\ref{cross_2}\nand \\ref{approx}, respectively. Since the cross sections of  eq.\n\\ref{approx} are functions of the minimum impact parameter, the\nvalues reported in the Table have been calculated according to the\nexperimental angular ranges reported in the seventh column. Except\nfor the $^{11}$Be case, for which the discrepancy between theory and\nexperiment is known (see discussion above), the calculated cross\nsections are close to the experimental values. Nonetheless, the\ncalculated cross sections tend to be smaller than the experimental\nones for $^{17}$Ne, $^{32}$Mg, $^{38}$S, $^{40}$S, $^{42}$S,\n$^{44}$Ar, and $^{46}$Ar projectiles. This is worrisome because the\nB($\\pi\\lambda$) values were extracted from the experimentally\nobtained cross sections, using equations similar to eq.\n\\ref{approx}. These experimental B-values would have to be larger by\n$10-30$\\% according to our calculations.\n\nIt is important to stress the fact that many experimental data on\nunstable nuclei collected up to now have been analyzed by means of\ntheoretical tools (DWBA and coupled-channels codes) which do not\ninclude relativistic {\\it dynamics} (the inclusion of relativistic\n{\\it kinematics} is straightforward). This problem was first\naddressed in ref. \\cite{Ber05}, where it was shown that the analysis\nof experimental data at intermediate energies without a proper\ntreatment of relativistic dynamics leads to wrong values of\nelectromagnetic transition probabilities. We should stress that a\nfull theoretical treatment of relativistic dynamics of strong and\nelectromagnetic interactions in many-body systems is very difficult\nand still does not exist \\cite{Ber05}.\n\n\\begin{tabular}\n[c]{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}\\hline\nData & Projectile & Target & E$_{\\text{lab}}$ & $\\pi\\lambda$ & B($\\pi\\lambda\n$) & $\\theta_{\\text{range}}$ & E$_{x}$ & $\\sigma_{\\exp}$ & $\\sigma_{\\text{th}%\n}$ & $\\sigma_{\\text{app}}$\\\\\\hline\\hline 1 \\cite{Ann95} & $^{11}$Be\n& Pb & 43. & E1 & 0.115 & $<5^{\\circ}$ & 0.32\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$) & $191\\pm26$ & 328. &\n323.\\\\\\hline 2 \\cite{Ann95} & $^{11}$Be & Pb & 59.4 & E1 & 0.094 &\n$<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32 ($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$)\n& $304\\pm43$ & 213. & 211.\\\\\\hline 3  \\cite{Fau97} & $^{11}$Be & Au\n& 57.6 & E1 & 0.079 & $<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$) & $244\\pm31$ & 170. &\n168.\\\\\\hline 4 \\cite{Nak97} & $^{11}$Be & Pb & 64. & E1 & 0.099 &\n$<3.8^{\\circ}$ & 0.32 ($\\frac{1}{2}^{+}\\rightarrow\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$)\n& $302\\pm31$ & 217. & 215.\\\\\\hline 5 \\cite{Ch97,Ch02} & $^{17}$Ne &\nAu & 60. & M1 & 0.163 & $<4.5^{\\circ}$ & 1.29\n($\\frac{1}{2}^{-}\\rightarrow\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$) & $12\\pm4$ & 12.6 &\n13.0\\\\\\hline 6 \\cite{Mot95} & $^{32}$Mg & Pb & 49.2 & E2 & 454 &\n$<4^{\\circ}$ & 0.885 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $91.7\\pm14.4$ &\n137. & 128.\\\\\\hline 7 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{38}$S & Au & 39.2 & E2 & 235\n& $<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.29 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $59\\pm7$ & 48. &\n45.0\\\\\\hline 8 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{40}$S & Au & 39.5 & E2 & 334 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 0.91 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $94\\pm9$ & 75.5 &\n70.4\\\\\\hline 9 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{42}$S & Au & 40.6 & E2 & 397 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 0.89 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $128\\pm19$ & 101.\n& 94.3\\\\\\hline 10 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{44}$Ar & Au & 33.5 & E2 & 345 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.14 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $81\\pm9$ & 62.3 &\n58.3\\\\\\hline 11 \\cite{Ch97} & $^{46}$Ar & Au & 35.2 & E2 & 196 &\n$<4.1^{\\circ}$ & 1.55 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $53\\pm10$ & 40.9 &\n38.2\\\\\\hline 12 \\cite{Gad03} & $^{46}$Ar & Au & 76.4 & E2 & 212 &\n$<2.9^{\\circ}$ & 1.55 ($0^{+}\\rightarrow2^{+}$) & $68\\pm8$ & 50.0 &\n47.4\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\medskip\n\nTable 1.

These cross sections were\ncalculated assuming that the detectors collect events from all\npossible Coulomb scattering events. In a real experimental\nsituation, the angular distribution is restricted to angular\nwindows, reducing the available cross sections. Only the lowest\nlying transitions have been considered, i.e. from the ground to the\nfirst excited states. One observes that some cross sections are very\nlarge, specially for $^{11}$Be, $^{18}$Ne, $^{30}$Ne and $^{54}$Ni.\nFor these and other similar cases, the measurements are easy to\nperform, with a large number of events/second even with modest\nintensities. Cases such as $^{16}$C are well within the experimental\npossibilities in most radioactive beam facilities.\n\nTable 2 also shows that, except for M1 excitations, the Coulomb\nexcitation cross sections decrease steadily as the energy increases\nfrom 10 to 500 MeV/nucleon. Based on these numbers alone, one could\nconclude that Coulomb excitation of low-lying states (in contrast to\nthe case of high-lying states, e.g. giant resonances \\cite{BB85})\nare better suited for studies at low energies. However, reactions at\nlower energies while are less influenced by contamination due to\nnuclear breakup \\cite{BCH95,Cha07} can give rise to large high-order\neffects \\cite{BC92}. The interpretation of data could be distorted\nas in the case of Coulomb dissociation of $^8$B at low energy\n\\cite{Kolata}, which was completely misinterpreted in terms of\nfirst-order calculations. In some situations, when higher-order\neffects are relevant, the effect of the nuclear breakup cannot be\nneglected either \\cite{Gai,Vitturi}. Thus, the choice of the\nincident energy would depend on the experimental conditions.\nIdentification of gamma-rays from de-excitation using Doppler shift\ntechniques are often more advantageous at higher energies. Moreover,\nexcept for few cases (e.g. $^{11}$C), the magnetic dipole\ntransitions are much smaller than those for $E1$ and $E2$\ntransitions. Even for M1 transitions the measurements are under the\npossibility of most new experimental facilities.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\begin{figure}[ptb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[\nheight=4.0906in, width=4.3154in ]{fig2.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross section of \\ the first excited state in\n$^{11}$Be, $^{11}$B and $^{54}$Ni and of the 13.05 MeV sate in $^{16}$O\nprojectiles incident on Pb targets as a function of the laboratory energy.}%\n\\label{fig2}%\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\bigskip\n\nThe comparison of the exact calculations, using eq. \\ref{cross_2}\n(solid lines), and the approximations \\ref{approx} (dashed lines)\nare shown in figs. 2(a-d), for $^{11}$Be, $^{11}$B, $^{54}$Ni and\n$^{16}$O, respectively. The $^{16}$O case (as well as for $^{12}$C\nin Table 2) was included for comparison, with a high-lying excited\nstate. We see from figs 2a and 2b that the approximations in eq.\n\\ref{approx} work quite well for the $M1$ multipolarity and\nreasonably well (within 20\\% at 10 MeV/nucleon and 5\\% at 50\nMeV/nucleon) for the $E1$ cases. But they fail badly at low and\nintermediate energies for the $E2$ ( fig. 2c). The reason is that\nthe $E2$ Coulomb field (\\textquotedblleft tidal\nfield\\textquotedblright) is very sensitive to the details of the\ncollision dynamics at low energies. These conclusions can be\ndeceiving since even for the $E1$ and $M1$ cases the approximations\nin eq. \\ref{approx} may strongly differ from the exact calculations\nif the excitation energy is large (see discussion in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}). This is shown in figure 2d, where we plot the Coulomb\nexcitation cross section of the $E_{x}=13.09$ MeV state in $^{16}$O.\nIn this case, the cross sections based on eq. \\ref{approx} is a\nfactor of 10 smaller than the exact calculation at 10 MeV/nucleon.\nAt 100 MeV/nucleon this difference drops to 10\\%, which still needs\nto be considered with care.\n\nIn summary, in this article we have used the formalism of ref.\n\\cite{Ber03} to predict the cross sections for Coulomb excitation of\nseveral light projectiles with electromagnetic transitions found in\nthe literature, listed in the TUNL database \\cite{tunl}, and for a\nfew other selected cases. These estimates will be useful for planing\nCoulomb excitation experiments at present and future heavy ion\nfacilities. It is evident that the inclusion of relativistic effects\ncombined with Coulomb distortion are of the utmost relevance. The cross section inferred by using\nnon-relativistic or pure relativistic treatments can be wrong by up\nto 30\\% even at 100 MeV/nucleon, as shown here and in ref.\n\\cite{Ber03}. Finally, the use of Coulomb excitation to produce\nnuclei in high-lying states is an important tool to study particle\nemission processes. For example, the excitation of $^{18}$Ne and its\nsubsequent decay by two-proton emission is a process of large\ntheoretical and experimental interest. Experimental work in this\ndirection is in progress \\cite{Ra06}.\n\n\\section*{\\bigskip}\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\textbf{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract\nNo. DE-AC05-00OR22725 (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) with UT-Battelle, LLC.,\nand by DE-FC02-07ER41457 with the University of Washington (UNEDF, SciDAC-2).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}                                                                                               %\n\n\n\\bibitem {AW75}K.~Alder and A.~Winther, Electromagnetic Excitation,\nNorth-Holland, Amsterdam, 1975.\n\n\\bibitem {Ber03}C.A.~Bertulani, A.E.~Stuchbery, T.J.~Mertzimekis and\nA.D.~Davies, Phys.

In the last years, many research groups, with different\nexperimental techniques like non linear magneto-optical\nrotation\\cite{budk_rev02}, spin-exchange relaxation free - Faraday rotation \\cite{romalisSERF}, double resonance optical\npumping \\cite{Groe06}, and Coherent Population Trapping (CPT)\n\\cite{Kna02,NOI} have obtained important records in optical\nmagnetometry  sensitivity, so to prove that atomic magnetometers are\npresently competitive  even with SQUID magnetometers in terms of\nsensitivity, and can find applications in fields like geomagnetism\nmonitoring, testing of materials, testing of fundamental symmetries of\nPhysics and bio-magnetism detection.   \n\nThe first mapping of the cardiomagnetic field with a Rubidium double\nresonance magnetometer has been demonstrated in ref.\\cite{wei03a}, and\ngood agreement with  the magnetocardiogram obtained by a SQUID\nmagnetocardiograph has been found\\cite{wei03b}. \n\nThe unique experiment of M. Romalis and coworkers \\cite{Xia06},\nrecently showed that laser magnetometers can perform records in\nregistration of  such weak (few hundreds fT) magnetic fields as those\nproduced by the human brain activity. \n\nA fundamental request for  actually reaching the  sensitivity level\nneeded for bio-signal detection is to reduce dramatically the\nenvironmental magnetic field. Usually high magnetic permeability\nmaterials like  $\\mu$-metal are employed  to build small volumes\ninside of which  it is possible to have very effective  shielding of\nthe external, undesired magnetic fields. \n\nThe high cost  of such magnetically clean chambers represents a strong\nlimitation for the diffusion  of high sensitive magnetometry in\nclinical application, also because of their delicateness and\npossible magnetization with consequent requirement of periodical\ndemagnetizing treatments.   \n \nThe main limits of working in unshielded environmental conditions,\ntypical in a scientific laboratory, are given by the presence of\nstrong magnetic field gradients, ac magnetic fields in the volume of\nsensor cell and by the magnetic noise produced by other human\nactivities and ionospheric phenomena.  \n\nField gradients  affect the sensitivity limit of the instrument by\nintroducing  a broadening of the detected resonance\nline. Time-dependent magnetic fields represent a further  additional\nsource limiting the magnetic field detection sensitivity.  \n\nThe possibility of achieving high sensitivity, simply by passively\nquenching magnetic noise (placing  thick Al plates around the magnetic\nsensor), has been shown in ref.\\cite{seltz04}. There a sensitivity  of\nthe order of $1\\rm{pT}/\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ is obtained thanks to a\nsophisticated feedback system that, keeping around  zero the total\nmagnetic field value in the volume of a K  cell (heated to\n$170^{\\circ}C$), suppresses the broadening due to\nspin-exchange-collisions.    \n\nIn the present work, we show that a cheap system for eliminating\nspatial inhomogeneities of the background magnetic field, joined to an\naccurately balanced differential detection scheme, allows for\ndetecting the magnetic signal produced by the heart activity\nwithout the use of neither expensive and bulky shielding chambers nor\naluminum shields that attenuate high-frequency magnetic noise. The\ndevice consists in a full optical sensor operating at room\ntemperature, placed inside a frame of compensation coils that can be\neasily accessed by a human body. \n   \n\n\\section{Basics of the measurement principle}\n\\label{principles}\nMagnetic field optical detection is performed by creating\nCPT\\cite{NOI, And03} on   Zeeman sublevels of the F=3 hyperfine\nground state of Cs atoms.  \n\nThis is an all optical technique as it does not require the presence\nof coils in the proximity of the sensor cell in order to produce\ndirect RF magnetic excitation. This feature makes easy to optimize the\nsensitivity to any orientation of the magnetic field, thus allowing\nfor measuring any component of it. CPT is produced  when circularly polarized\nlaser radiation, resonant with a $\\rm{D}_2$ optical transition, is frequency\nmodulated exactly at the Zeeman frequency splitting of the ground\nZeeman sublevels. The CPT signal can be seen as a resonant decrement\nof the absorption in the optical transition. The measure of the\nresonant frequency $\\omega_L$ gives directly an absolute measurement\nof the modulus of the magnetic field interacting with the atomic probe.  \n\n This kind of magnetic field measurement is absolute and\n self-calibrated because the magnetic field strength $B$  is given by: \n$B = \\frac{\\omega_L}{\\mu_0 g_F}$, where  $\\mu_0$ is the Bohr magneton,\n $g_F$ is the Land\\'e factor of the considered ground-state and\n $\\omega_L$ is the resonance  (Larmor) frequency. The magnetometer is\n a scalar one and the  estimation  of the  magnetic field modulus is\n obtained  by scaling  the Larmor frequency by atomic constants, and\n only minor deviations  may occur \\cite{Wyn99}, introducing small\n systematic errors. Long time  living coherence between Zeeman\n sublevels allows for creating  very  narrow (few Hz) resonances and\n then for getting  very sensitive  magnetic field estimations.  Cs\n optical transitions can be excited by means of diode laser\n radiation, that can be easily  modulated in frequency  by means of\n the modulation of its injection  current. Magnetic field intensities in the\n geophysical range, correspond to  frequency modulations of the order\n of 100~kHz. This  gives the  possibility of performing high precision\n magnetic field measurement while  operating in  the presence of the\n local Earth  magnetic field, by  employing  RF modulation of the\n laser current\\cite{budk_mod_02,Aco06, NOI}. \n\nThe presented experimental investigation is dedicated to the\ndetection of a small, time varying  field in the presence of about\n$10^6$ times stronger dc bias field, for any  relative  orientation\nof the two fields. As any scalar magnetometer, our setup is sensitive to the component of the\nvarying magnetic field in the direction of the bias field (see also Section\n\\ref{inhomogeneities}).\n\n\\section{Sensor set-up}\nThe sensor set-up is sketched in Fig.\\ref{setupSINGLEcell}.\nLaser source is a single-mode edge-emitting pigtail laser ($\\lambda$=\n852~nm) with 15~mW of laser power and an intrinsic line-width of\nless than 5~MHz. Laser light is coupled to a single-mode\npolarization-maintaining fiber 10~m in length and the laser head,\ncontaining the laser chip, a 40~dB optical isolator, the temperature\nstability system (Peltier junction and the thermistor), and the fiber \ncollimator is contained into a compact butterfly housing of  $\\mbox\n40~\\textrm{cm}^3$.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi01.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{ Experimental setup. PMOF: polarization maintaining optical\n  fiber, CL:collimating lens, IBS: intensity beam splitter, \n    NF: neutral filters, PD: photodiode. }\\label{setupSINGLEcell}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\nThe beam exiting from the fiber is  collimated  then  split by an\nintensity beam splitter (IBS1). The beam reflected by IBS1 passes\ntrough a vacuum reference cell and the transmitted light is detected\nin order to monitor the laser frequency tuning with respect to the\nDoppler line. The beam transmitted trough IBS1 is split again by a\nsecond intensity beam splitter IBS2. The  beam reflected by IBS2 is\nmade parallel  to the transmitted one after  reflection on a mirror M\nand plays the role of a second arm of the sensor. The two arms\ninteraxial separation $\\Delta$ is chosen to be about 7 cm.  The\npolarization of both the beams is adjusted by means of two $\\lambda/4$\nplates. Both beams cross, in different points,  a single cell,\ncontaining Cs and 5~Torr of $Ar$ as a buffer gas.  The use of a single\ncylindrical cell, 9~cm in length and 1.5~cm in radius guarantees equal\nconditions for CPT creation (equal Cs and Ar vapor density in the two\nlaser-atoms interaction volumes). All the component represented \nin Fig.\\ref{setupSINGLEcell} are mounted on a non magnetic plate and the \noverall dimensions of the sensor are $25\\times12\\times4$~$\\rm{cm}^3$. \n\nIn order to reduce power broadening, laser power  is reduced to less than\n$50~\\mbox{$\\mu W$}$ in each sensor arm using a set of neutral\nfilters. A non magnetic translating  blade is placed after the\ncell, in front of one (the most sensitive) of the two photo-diodes, in\norder to have the possibility of fine balancing the detected\nphoto-currents. \n \n \nIn order to increase the signal to noise ratio of the detected signal,\nphase sensitive detection is used. At this aim, we impose a 20~kHz\nfrequency modulation on the RF frequency modulating the laser current\nand then detect the component of the signal oscillating at this frequency.  \n\n\\section{Sensitivity optimization for cardio-signal detection}\nThe magnetic field produced by a  human heart is characterized by a\nmaximum intensity of about 100~pT in the close vicinity of the chest,\nand the main features are well reconstructed if sampled in a bandwidth\nof at least 30~Hz \\cite{wei03a}.  \n\nMagnetic heart-beat spatially confined distribution, of the order of the\nheart dimensions, allows for performing differential detection in a\nrather small volume in front of the patient's chest, while the\npossibility of triggering the acquisition on other signal, taken for\nexample from the electro-cardiogram (or even from a simple pulse\noximeter), allows for effective noise rejection in an off-line analysis. \n\nAs introduced before, unshielded environmental conditions limit the\ninstrumental sensitivity essentially because of  the temporal and \nspatial fluctuation of the background magnetic field. Field gradients\nin our laboratory have the typical magnitude of about 100~$\\rm{nT}/\\rm{cm}$\ndepending on the presence of magnetic material both in the\ninstrumentation and in the building structure. Alternating magnetic\nfields contribute instead, mainly with $50~\\rm{Hz}$ and higher odd\norder harmonics, with a typical rms amplitude of the order of 100~nT\ndepending on the vicinity of electric lines and power supply\ntransformers. For  frequencies higher than the lock-in cut-off\nfrequency, ac fields determine  an effective broadening of the CPT\nline, while  for lower frequencies they directly introduce time\nfluctuation  of  the CPT resonance center. Optimization of the\nmagnetometer sensitivity is fundamentally performed on the basis of\nthe spatial and temporal characteristics of the bio-signal to be measured.  \n\nIn order to improve the common mode noise rejection it is important to\nhave, in absence of the magnetic source to be measured, exactly the\nsame resonance profile at the  two inputs of the differential lock-in\namplifier. As shown in Ref.\\cite{Kna02} small differences in  laser\npower, polarization, beam-size contribute significantly to the\nunbalance  by changing the amplitude and the shape (mainly) of the\nCPT resonance. Difference between the magnetic field values inside the\ntwo laser-atom interaction volumes shifts instead the positions of the\nresonances centers.  \n\nThe cardiac signal measurement procedure consists in, first, \nadjustment of  amplitude and width of the CPT signals in the two arms\nseparately (single input mode of the lock-in amplifier) and, second,\nfine optimization of those parameters by looking at the maximum\ncommon mode noise cancellation in the differential signal\n(differential input mode of the lock-in amplifier).     \n\n\n\\subsection{Field inhomogeneities compensation}\n\\label{inhomogeneities}\nAs mentioned in Section \\ref{principles}, measuring the modulus of $B$\nin the presence of a strong dc component, leads to detect only the\nvariations $\\Delta B$ of the field in the component parallel to the dc, bias\nfield since \n$\\Delta \\left|\\vec{B}\\right|\\simeq\n\\frac{\\vec{B}}{\\left|\\vec{B}\\right|}\\cdot\\Delta\\vec{B}$. \n\nBy zeroing two of the three spatial component of the local background\nmagnetic field, one is  able to measure one selected  component of the\nsignal produced by the biological source. This gives the possibility\nof studying   the different components of the measured field and\neventually  reconstructing the entire vectorial signal. \n\nThe typical configuration for  a cardio-signal detection measurement\nis sketched in Fig.\\ref{cubo_paziente}. In this particular\nconfiguration both $x$ and $y$ components of the laboratory\nmagnetic field are compensated (the residual magnetic field is in the\n0.1~${\\rm{\\mu} T}$ range) and thus, the $z$ component of the human \nheart magnetic beat is being detected. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Jbelfi02.eps\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Schematics of the apparatus.  The selected component of the background\nbias field  $B_0$, parallel to $\\hat{z}$ in the scheme, determines the\ndirection of the detected component of the bio-signal, while laser\nbeams separated by  $\\Delta$ are directed along $\\hat{x}$. Dipoles are used\nfor gradients compensation.  \\label{cubo_paziente}} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThis  detection scheme has important advantages in view of simplifying the compensation of \nmagnetic field inhomogeneities. As explained in deeper detail in the Appendix, \nin fact, only 3 currents for the compensation of the spatial gradients inside the cell volume,\nare needed in addiction to the 2 currents employed for the zeroing of\ntwo of the three component of the laboratory magnetic field. These three\ncurrents  flow respectively in one anti-Helmholtz pair  and in two\nsmall coils playing the role of magnetic dipoles. \n\nAfter the optimization of the gradient compensation we get a strong\nreduction of the line broadening due to magnetic field\ninhomogeneities. Fig. \\ref{restringimento}  shows the CPT resonance\nsignal registered with and without the compensation of spatial\ngradients. Without compensation a best fit analysis gives a \nlinewidth (FWHM) of  about 1.7~kHz which is reduced down to less than\n300~Hz in case of gradients compensation.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi03.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{CPT line-shapes produced with circular polarization and\n  magnetic field orientation orthogonal to the laser beam (along\n  $\\widehat{z}$ direction). Circles: static gradients are not\n  compensated. Fitted line-width is 1.67~kHz. Squares: optimized\n  compensation of the gradient components. Fitted line-width is\n  reduced to 280~Hz.  \\label{restringimento}} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Differential measurement procedure and noise characterization}\n\nDepending on the spatial configuration of the local magnetic field in\ncorrespondence of  the two light-atoms interaction volumes, we are\nable to cancel different noise contributions at the cost of increasing\nthe uncorrelated electronic noise in the detection stage by namely a\nfactor of  $\\sqrt{2}$. Other noise sources, like laser frequency noise\nand amplitude noise are systematically canceled from the signal\nprovided that the two arms are  balanced. If, furthermore, both arms\nof the sensor give CPT resonance exactly at the same resonant\nfrequency, then even the common mode magnetic field noise, generated\nfor example by all far magnetic sources is eliminated. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{cardiac_noise} is presented the magnetometric noise spectral\ndensity for different operating conditions of the device. Trace (a) is\nrelative to a single arm operation: laser noise and magnetic common mode\nnoise contribute entirely. Trace (b) is obtained in differential input\nacquisition, where the two CPT resonances occur at frequencies\nseparated by more than the CPT linewidth. In this case one mainly gets\nthe cancellation of the laser frequency and intensity noise. Evident\ngain in the reduction of residual noise is obtained in the\ndifferential acquisition when CPT resonances detected by the two\nsensors are accurately overlapped (trace (c)).  Trace (d) and (e) are\nrecorded respectively in differential and single input mode, when the\nlaser frequency is tuned  out of the single photon (Doppler) resonance. It\nis evident that the uncorrelated electronic noise increases in the\ndifferential detection.    \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi04.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{a)~Single input acquisition: laser frequency is tuned to the\n  center of the CPT resonance. b)~Differential input acquisition: CPT\n  signals  on the two arms of the sensor are separated by more than\n  the CPT linewidth. c)~Differential input acquisition: CPT signals\n  overlapping is optimized. d)~Out of Doppler absorption resonance\n  noise in differential input mode. e)~Out of Doppler absorption\n  resonance noise in single input mode. In the inset is reported  the total rms noise $N$ integrated betweeen 1 Hz and 30 Hz (cardio-signal bandwidth) relative to each trace.  \\label{cardiac_noise}} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{Cardio signal data analysis}\nThe signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is not high enough to make single\ncardiac pulse directly observable, so that off-line analysis must\ninclude both linear filtration  and averaging of the data. We use a standard\ntechnique for acquiring a  reference signal simultaneously with the\nmagnetometric data. Our digital  lock-in amplifier (Stanford SR830)\nallows for storing up to 16384 data in a  buffer, which can be\nsynchronously acquired using an external clock.  Thus we use an\nexternal DAQ card (MCC 1608FS, 16~bit resolution, with USB  interface)\nwhose ADC operation triggers the lock-in data storage. Such DAQ is\nused to sample reference data produced by either the pulse-oximeter or\nan  electrocardiographic connection.  \n\nIn the case of the pulse-oximeter, we arranged an IR led and a \nphototransistor in such a way  to sense the transparency \nvariation of a finger, and give several hundred mV signal\npeak-to-peak. Alternatively, the ECG was performed by acquiring digitally the\nelectric signal collected by two electrodes placed in the vicinity of\nthe heart, after a passive low-pass filtering, necessary to reduce the\nnoise aliasing. Specifically, as we use typically a 128~S/s\nacquisition rate, a 18~dB/oct filter made with a three-stage RC\ncutting at 40~Hz, produced a clean signal about 1~mV at the  \nQRS complex.\n\nIn both cases, the reference signal needs some preliminary (off-line) \nnumerical conditioning before being used as a trigger. Namely, some linear \nfiltering is performed to remove slow drifts and high frequency noise (a \n3rd order bandpass numerical filter from 0.2~Hz to 30~Hz is usually \nsuitable). After this, the envelope of the reference is evaluated, and used \nto normalize the peak-to-peak amplitude all along the registration. \nFinally, the normalized reference is used to produce a trigger signal \nwhich is adjustable in slope, threshold and hold-off, similarly to standard \noscilloscopes. Additionally, and in particular when using pulse-oximeter \nreference, it is important to adjust a (negative) trigger delay, of\nsome tenths of second, due to the  relevant lag between the heart\npulse and the change on the finger  transparency. Both references\nshowed to be suitable for data average triggering. \n\nThe magnetocardiographic data downloaded from the lock-in data buffer are \nfirstly numerically filtered with the aim of removing specific spectral \ncomponents (such as 50~Hz noise) and other spectral peaks due to artifacts (such as mechanical vibration of the Helmholtz coils) then split in traces \ncorresponding to single heart pulses, from which the average pulse can be \nreconstructed by  averaging.\n\nThe averaging process is not straightforward, due to the fact that the \npulse duration is not stable. We tried two different approaches to superpose and average \nthe single-pulse traces. In the first one, we strengthen the arrays \ncontaining the single pulse traces to a given size by linear\ninterpolation, to make all  of them equal in length; while in the\nsecond procedure we add zeros at  the end of the shorter arrays to\nmake all of them as long as the longest  one. It turns out that the\nsecond procedure is more effective and correct,  due to the fact that\n(as can be seen also by the ECG traces) the traces  corresponding to\nsingle pulse cardiac activity are not similar to each other. \n\nSpecifically, each trace starts with a P-QRS-T complex having a pretty \nstable duration, followed by a quiescent interval whose duration is rather \nvariable in time, which is the main responsible for the\nnon-periodicity of the signal.  As a consequence, using ECG\nreference, one finds that the averaging is the best (and the best\nis the S/N obtained) when triggering on the QRS complex (the highest peak)\nwith a delay suitable to include the P wave of the same beat,\nwhile the location where the quiescent phase is being cut is not\nrelevant, provided that the T wave of the previous beat is not\nincluded. In the case of pulse-oximeter as a reference the correct\ntrigger delay must be found empirically due to its intrinsic additional delay.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{Single_cardiac_pulse} is reported a reconstructed\nmagnetic heart-beat, obtained by placing the sensor close to the chest of\none of the authors. The peak is obtained from a data set consisting in\n16384 points acquired at a sampling rate of 128~Hz. Average is\n thus performed on a set of about 150 heart-beats, corresponding to 128~sec\nof measuring time. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Jbelfi05.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Reconstructed cardiac pulse. The signal is averaged over a\n  set of about 150 cardiac pulses acquired at 128~Hz sampling rate.

We discussed simple approaches for\nmagnetic-field and magnetic-field-gradient compensation, as well as\noff-line data analysis of quasi-periodic signals.\nThe noise characterization showed that a severe limitation to the\nsensitivity would be set by the background magnetic field fluctuation,\nwhich, thanks to its essential uniformity can be effectively canceled in\ndifferential measurements. Specific features of the presented\nmagnetometer, compared to others used at present lie in the facts that\nit works at room temperature and can be fast adjusted to detect\ndifferent components of the weak biologic magnetic field vector, as\nthe sensor, being purely optical, does not include coils,  which would\nconstitute geometrical constraints. The simplicity of the method, its low cost\nand low maintenance cost can be a crucial factor for its\ndissemination in clinical applications.\n\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section*{Magnetic-field and gradient compensation}\nIn this appendix, we report the principles of the strategy  for the resonance\nnarrowing, shown in Fig.~\\ref{restringimento}, obtained by means of\nmagnetic field and magnetic field gradient conditioning. \n\nIn order to be able to independently compensate each of the three\ncomponents of the magnetic  field vector, while introducing minimum\ninhomogeneities, it is straightforward to  use three pairs of coils in\nHelmholtz configuration (which for squared  coils means to place them\nat a distance of about 0.544~L, L being the length of the coil side). \n\n\nThe center  of the Cs vapor cell, the core of the optical sensor, is\nthen placed at the geometrical  center of  a \"cube\" composed by a set\nof three pairs of squared ($180\\times180\\,\\rm{cm}^2$) coils\n($180\\times0.544$ is just enough to make possible a human body to\naccess the cube).\n\n%, each coil having inductance L=0.3~Henry, and\n%resistance of  7.5~$\\Omega$. \n  \nBasic arguments  give that not only $\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}$, but\nalso $\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{B}$ is zero in the position of the\nsensor, as no current flows there. As a  direct consequence, only five out of \nthe nine elements of the matrix $\\partial B_i/\\partial x_j$ are \nindependent, i.e. only five parameters have to be controlled for their \ncompensation. More precisely, a complete compensation requires to controll \ntwo of the three diagonal elements, and three of the six \noff-diagonal elements.\n\n\nThe diagonal elements can be compensated by anti-Helmholtz coils. This \nmeans that two additional couples of coils with counter-propagating \ncurrents could be used to compensate $\\partial B_x/\\partial x $ \nand  $\\partial B_y/\\partial y $ (which would guarantee also the \ncompensation of $\\partial B_z/\\partial z $). In principle, such \nanti-Helmholtz coils should be at a larger distance, in order to produce \nthe linear term $\\partial B_i/\\partial x_i$ and not the cubic one. But for \nsimplicity, considering the small corrections to be made, is preferable to \nuse the already existing Helmholtz pairs (with which, by the way, one has \nalso the advantage of producing a maximum gradient, given the current).\n\n\nThis choice leads to simultaneously compensate the $x$ and\n$y$ components of the field and the three diagonal components of  the\ngradient, by separately controlling the currents in the four Helmholtz\ncoils for  $B_x$ and $B_y$ compensation. Specifically, indicating with\n$I_{x1}$ and $I_{x2}$ the currents in the coils around the $x$ axis, $B_x$ is\ncontrolled by $(I_{x1}+I_{x2})$ and $\\partial B_x/\\partial x $ is\ncontrolled by $(I_{x1}-I_{x2})$ (similarly for the y direction). If\nonly $B_x$ and $B_y$ are to be compensated, so that only $B_z$\ninhomogeneities are relevant a simpler control can be made with\nthree currents only, using pure Helmholtz configuration in $x$ and $y$\ndirections ($(I_{x1}=I_{x2})$, $(I_{y1}=I_{y2})$), and pure anti-Helmholtz \n$(I_{z1}=-I_{z2})$ configuration in the $z$ direction. In our present \nset-up, we opted for this latter, simpler choice.\n\n\nThe three independent off-diagonal elements of the gradient ($\\partial \nB_y/\\partial x$, $\\partial B_z/\\partial x$, $\\partial B_z/\\partial y$) can \nbe controlled with couples of magnetic dipoles symmetrically located far \naway from the sensor in order to produce a vanishing, quadrupole field in \nthe region of the cell. Again, provided that $\\partial B_y/\\partial x$ \nproduces negligible effects because not responsible for $B_z$ \ninhomogeneities, only two of these three couples needs to be\neffectively  adjusted. We actually use dipoles oriented in $z$\ndirection and  located in the $xy$ plane. As the dipole  field gradient \ndecreases with the fourth power of the distance, fixing the dipoles on the\nframe of the large Helmholtz coils  would make necessary to use pretty\nlarge current and pretty heavy coils. We  simplified our task by using\nseveral couples of Nd permanent magnets in order  to coarsely compensate\nthe off-diagonal gradient components, and smaller  electromagnets with\nfew hundreds mA current for fine adjustments. \n\n\n\\acknowledgments\nThe authors thank R.\\ Mariotti and  M.\\ Focardi for very useful discussions. \nS.

The mechanical behavior of many real\nfluids, especially those of low molecular weight, appears to be\naccurately described by these equations over a wide range of\ncircumstances. There are, however, many real substances which are\ncapable of flowing but which are not at all well described by the\nNavier-Stokes theory. Due to this reason many fluid models have been\nproposed and studied by different authors. Among these, the fluids\nof differential type have received much attention. Interesting\nstudies of differential type fluids are given by Rajagopal\n\\cite{Rajagopal1}, Erdogan \\cite{Erdogan}, Rajagopal and Gupta\n\\cite{Gupta}, Bandelli \\cite{Bandelli1}, Siddiqui and Kaloni\n\\cite{Siddiqui0}, Benharbit and Siddiqui \\cite{Siddiqui1}, Ariel\n\\cite{Ariel0, Ariel1}, Fetecau and Fetecau \\cite{Fetecau} and Hayat\net al. \\cite{Hayat3, Hayat4, Hayat5}. The fluids of third grade,\nwhich form a subclass of the fluids of differential type, have been\nsuccessfully studied in various types of motions.\n\nMoro et al. \\cite{Moro} determined some exact solutions of the\nequations governing the steady plane motion of an incompressible\nthird grade fluid employing hodograph and Legendre transformations.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present some exact solutions for steady\nplane motions of incompressible third grade fluids. For this, the\ncomplex variables and complex functions are used. Some previous\nsolutions can be obtained as special cases of our solutions. In\nsections 2 and 3 are presented the constitutive equations and the\nexpression of the vorticity function $\\omega.$ Section 4 contains\nsolutions and their graphical illustrations.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:level2}Constitutive and governing equations}\n\nThe fluids of grade $n,$ introduced by Rivlin and Ericksen\n\\cite{Rivlin}, are the fluids for which the stress tensor is a\npolynomial of degree $n$ in the first $n$ Rivlin-Ericksen tensors\ndefined recursively by \\bea \\nonumber &&A_1 = (\\partial_i u_j\n+\\partial_j u_i)_{i,\\, j}\\,;\\\\&& A_n = \\frac{d}{dt}A_{n-1} + A_{n-1}\nL + L^t A_{n-1}\\,, \\,\\,\\, n > 1 \\eea where $\\frac{d}{dt}=\\partial_t + u\n\\cdot\\nabla$ denotes the material derivative and\n\\begin{equation}\nL=(\\partial_j u_i)_{i,\\,j} \\, \\, ; \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, L^t=(\\partial_i\nu_j)_{i,\\,j} \\, .\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nPhysical considerations were taken into account by Fosdick and\nRajagopal \\cite{Fosdic} in order to obtain the following form of\nconstitutive equation for the Cauchy stress $T$ in a third grade\nfluid: \\bea\\nonumber &&T = -pI + \\mu\nA_1+\\alpha_1A_2+\\alpha_2A^2_1+\\beta_1 A_3+\\\\&&+\n\\beta_2[A_1A_2+A_2A_1]+\\beta_3(tr A^2_1)A_1 \\eea where $-pI$ is the\nspherical stress due to the constraint of incompressibility, $\\mu$\nis the dynamic viscosity, $\\alpha_i(i=1,2)$ and $\\beta_i(i=1,2,3)$\nare the material constants and the three\nRivlin-Ericksen tensors $A_1, A_2$ and $A_3$ are given in equation (1).\\\\\nFurthermore, a complete thermodynamic analysis of the constitutive\nequation (2) has been given by Fosdick and Rajagopal \\cite{Fosdic}.\nThe Clausius--Duhem inequality and the assumption that the Helmholtz\nfree energy is a minimum in equilibrium provide the following\nrestrictions, \\bea\\nonumber &&\\mu \\geq 0\\, ,\\,\\,\\,\\alpha_1 \\geq 0\\,\n,\\,\\,\\,|\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2| \\leq \\sqrt{24 \\mu \\beta_3}\\,,\\\\&&\n\\beta_1=\\beta_2=0\\, ,\\,\\,\\,\\beta_3 \\geq 0\\,. \\eea Thus equation (2)\nbecomes\n\\begin{equation}\nT=-pI+\\alpha_1 A_2 + \\alpha_2 A^2_1 +[\\mu +\\beta_3(tr A^2_1)]A_1\\, ,\n\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mu_{eff}= \\mu + \\beta_3(trA^2_1)$ is the effective\nshear-dependent viscosity.\\\\\nThe velocity field corresponding to the motion is given as:\n$$v=v(x,y)=(u(x,y), v(x,y), 0)\\,.$$\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:level3}Flow equations}\n\nThe basic equations governing the steady plane motion of a\nhomogeneous incompressible fluid of third grade, in the absence of\nbody forces are \\cite{Moro} \\bea \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} +\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}= 0 \\eea \\bea\\nonumber&& \\frac{\\partial\nh}{\\partial x}=\\rho v \\omega - \\mu\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial\ny}- \\alpha_{1}v \\nabla^{2}\\omega - \\beta_{3}\\frac{\\partial (\\omega\nM)}{\\partial y}+\\\\&&+ 2\\beta_{3}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\nx}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\nx}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y}) \\eea \\bea\\nonumber&& \\frac{\\partial\nh}{\\partial y}=-\\rho u \\omega+\\mu\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial\nx}+\\alpha_{1}u \\nabla^{2}\\omega+\\beta_{3}\\frac{\\partial (\\omega\nM)}{\\partial x}+\\\\&&+ 2\\beta_{3}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\ny}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y}) \\eea where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\omega = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nh=\\frac{\\rho q^{2}}{2}-\\alpha_{1}(u \\nabla^{2}u+v\\nabla^{2}v)-(3\n\\alpha_{1}+2\\alpha_{2})\\frac{M}{4}+p\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nM=4(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})^{2}+4(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\ny})^{2}+2(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} +\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\ny})^{2}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nq^{2}=u^{2}+v^{2}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nEquations (5) and (6) are non-linear partial differential equations\nfor three unknowns $u,\\,v$   and $\\rho$  as functions of $x$ and\n$y$.

this paper, we reconsidered the flow equations of Moro et al.\n\\cite{Moro} with the objective of determining some exact solutions.\n\nFor this purpose the vorticity function $\\omega$  and the stream\nfunction $\\psi$  are expressed in terms of complex variables and\ncomplex function. The condition which the complex functions must\nsatisfy is determined through the equations for the generalized\nenergy function $h$  by using the compatibility condition\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x\n\\partial y}= \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y \\partial x}$.\n\nSome exact solutions to the flow equations are determined using the\ncondition for the complex functions. The solutions presented in this\npaper admit, as particular cases, all the solutions of Moro et al.\n\\cite{Moro} by appropriately choosing the complex functions or the\narbitrary constants therein.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nI wish to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and\nsuggestions, which significantly improved the paper.\n\nI am also thankful to Prof. C.

However, besides strong electronic correlations, the topology of the underlying lattice structure itself\nconstitutes another important ingredient that can produce exotic electronic ground states.\n\nThe CoO$_2$-layers in the \\NCOx\\/ materials, which are built up from edge-sharing CoO$_6$ octahedra, constitute a realization of a correlated\nelectron system based on a triangular lattice. More specifically, these compounds possess a layered hexagonal structure, where strongly covalent\nCoO$_2$- and ionic Na-layers ($ab$-planes) alternate along the perpendicular $c$-axis \\cite{HuangPRB04a}. Upon changing the Na content $x$, these\nmaterials can be doped with electrons and, in addition, water molecules can be intercalated. Both changing $x$ and water intercalation drastically\nalter the electronic properties of \\NCOx, leading most notably to the emergence of superconductivity upon hydration \\cite{FooPRL04,TakadaNature03}.\n%\nWe will focus on the non-hydrated compounds with $x\\simeq0.7$, where an anomalous metallic state with an extremely large and field dependent\nthermoelectric power as well as a giant field dependent scattering rate was observed \\cite{WangNature03,LiPRL04}. There is also evidence for the\nseemingly paradoxical coexistence of electron itinerancy and localized magnetic moments, as well as for unusual charge order CDW phenomena in these\nmacroscopically metallic compounds \\cite{GavilanoPRB04,BernhardPRL04,NingPRL04}.\n\n\n%\n%The electronic properties described above can hardly be reconciled by any conventional band theory and, indeed, there is evidence for unusual spin,\n%charge and orbital correlations in \\NCOx \\/ \\cite{KhaliullinPRL04,DaghoferPreprint06}.\nThe unconventional electronic properties described above strongly motivate the study of the electronic structure of \\NCOx\\/ by means of angular\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which provides direct and unique experimental access to single-particle excitations and, thus, to the\nmany-body effects in these materials. Previous ARPES studies on \\NCOx\\/ \\cite{VallaNature02,YangPRL04,HasanPRL04,YangPRL05,QianPRL06,QianPRL06b}\nshowed pronounced deviations from the electronic structure predicted by LDA\ncalculations \\cite{SinghPRB00}. %Most notably the hole-pockets along the \\GK-direction predicted by LDA for $x<0.6$ were found to sink below the Fermi\n%energy $E_F$ \\cite{YangPRL05}.\nIn addition, a strongly renormalized heavy QP band, displaying a  kink feature was reported \\cite{YangPRL04,HasanPRL04,YangPRL05}.\n\n\n\nIn this ARPES study we focus on the momentum ($k$) dependent renormalization effects in \\NCO , which is\nessential to unravel the relevant couplings that govern the low energy physics. % and, hence, the electronic properties of this material.\n%\n%Sect. 2: Experiment\nARPES experiments were carried out using a lab-based system equipped with a SCIENTA SES 200 analyser and a Gammadata He discharge lamp at an\nexcitation energy $h \\nu = 21.2$\\,eV (energy resolution 30\\,meV, angular resolution 0.3$^{\\circ}$).\n%In addition, measurements at different excitation energies between 50\\,eV and 90\\,eV were carried out\n%using radiation from the U125/1-PGM beamline at the BESSY Synchrotron Radiation Facility and a SCIENTA SES 100 analyzer.\nThe high-quality \\NCO\\/ single crystals examined in this study were grown by the sodium chloride flux methods as described in Ref.\\,\\cite{Iljev04}.\n\n% Sect. 3: Lab-Results\n\n% Sect. 3.1: FL-Crossing\n\nA typical Fermi level ($E_F$) crossing observed at T=25\\,K is shown in Fig.\\,1, where the image on the left hand side shows the photoelectron\nintensity as a function of momentum $k$ and binding energy $E_B$. A single and well defined QP band, which crosses the Fermi energy at $E_B=0$\\,eV\ncan be observed. On the right hand side of Fig.\\,1 an energy distribution curve (EDC) and a momentum distribution curve (MDC)\nare shown. % demonstrating the very good quality of the obtained data.\n%\n%Sect. 3.2: Map data\nBy mapping the $E_F$ crossings over a large area of $k$-space, a cut through the Fermi surface (FS) of \\NCO\\/ parallel to the CoO$_2$ planes was\nmeasured. The data allows for a precise calibration of the $k$-scale, because dispersions from the first into the second Brillouin zone were\ncaptured. In Figs.\\,2\\,(a),(b) the $k$-dependent photoelectron intensity for two fixed binding energies of $E_B=0$\\,eV and 0.132\\,eV are shown.\n%\nFocussing on the cut at $E_B=0$\\,eV in Fig.\\,2\\,(a), a large hole-pocket centered around the Brillouin zone center $\\Gamma$ is observed. The FS\ndisplays a clear hexagonal topology. The intensity variations along the FS, leading to a seemingly lower symmetry, are caused by matrix element\neffects.\n%\nThe size of the observed FS agrees well with the doping level, provided that only one of the two $a_{1g}$-bands (cf. Fig.\\,2\\,(c)) crosses $E_F$.\nThis agrees with the data shown in Fig.\\,1, where a single QP-band crosses $E_F$ .\n\n%Note also that the sharp features at $E_F$ are indicative of a two-dimensional (2D) system, because a strong broadening would be expected for a\n%three-dimensional (3D) system (see discussion below) \\cite{StarnbergPRB93}.\n%\n\nIn accordance with previous studies, the hole-pockets along \\GK\\/ are not observed for $E_B=0$\\,eV.  It can be seen in Fig.\\,2\\,(b) that the\ncorresponding $e_g'$-band (cf. Fig.\\,2\\,(c)) lies well below $E_F$, as reported earlier \\cite{YangPRL05}.\n%\nThis can also be observed in Fig.\\,2\\,(c), where the measured band structure along \\GK \\/ and \\GM \\/ is compared to the band structure obtained by\nLDA \\cite{SinghPRB00}. There is a fair agreement of the ARPES data and LDA at higher binding energies above 1.5\\,eV. However, close to $E_F$\ndeviations occur which are particularly pronounced along \\GK.\n%\n\n\nIn Fig.\\,3 two cuts of the data set shown in Fig.\\,2 along the \\GK- (left) and \\GM-direction (right) are shown.\n%\nFocussing on the cut along  \\GK , two prominent features can be observed. First, there is a band crossing $E_F$ that forms the FS. Second, there is\nanother band at higher binding energies, which can be identified as the $e_g'$-band. The data indicates that the top of the $e_g'$-band is at about\n85\\,meV.\n\nBy tracking the maximum of the MDCs for different $E_B$, the QP-dispersion ($E(k)$) indicated by black symbols is obtained. Close to $E_F$ the\ndispersion can be well described by a linear behavior, yielding the Fermi velocity  $v_F=(0.3\\pm0.05)$\\,eV\\,\\AA \\/ along \\GK .\n%\nHowever, at slightly higher $E_B$, the measured dispersion is bent and thus deviates from the linear behavior close to $E_F$.\n%\nWe define the energy where this deviation becomes significant as $E_d$, resulting in $E_d=(26\\pm 8)$\\,meV for the \\GK-direction. The second bend in\nthe dispersion around 80\\,meV is related to the crossing of the two bands \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n%Turning to the cut along the \\GM-direction, a kink of the QP-band can also be observed.\nApplying the same analysis to the cut along \\GM\\/ leads to $v_F=(0.6\\pm0.08)$\\,eV\\,\\AA\\/ and $E_d=(66 \\pm 5)$\\,meV. Clearly, both $v_F$ and $E_d$\ndepend on the direction in $k$-space.\n\nThe observed bending of the dispersion that sets in around $E_d$ could be due to a coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations. In fact, consistent\nwith this interpretation, we observe an enhanced increase of the scattering rate around $E_d$.\n%\nIt has to be noted, however, that the feature in the dispersion observed here is not as well defined as the kink in the cuprates, for example. This\nmeans that  the values of $E_d$ cannot be identified straightforwardly with a specific mode energy and, moreover, a coupling to several different\nbosonic excitations is possible.\n\n\n%Sect. 3.4.: Anisotropic Renormalization:\nIn the following we will focus on $v_F$, which is a well defined quantity: Cuts for different $\\psi$-values (cf. Fig.\\,1\\,(b)) were systematically\nanalyzed in the same way as described above. The obtained variation of $v_F$ as determined from the ARPES data is shown in Fig.\\,4\\,(a). Upon\nrotating the direction of the cut from \\GM\\/ to \\GK\\/, $v_F$ decreases by about a factor of 2.\n%and the values for $v_F$ as well as $E_k$ are almost perfectly symmetric with respect to the \\GK-direction at $\\psi=210^{\\circ}$.\nUsing the function $k_F(\\psi)$ that was determined from the data in Fig.\\,2\\,(a) together with the obtained values of $v_F$, the variation of the\neffective mass $m^*$ with $\\psi$ can be calculated. The result is given in Fig.\\,4\\,(c). Remarkably, the QP along the \\GK\\/ direction is about twice\nas heavy as the QP along \\GM. This pronounced anisotropy of $m^*$ is expected to have a strong impact on the in-plane electronic properties of \\NCO.\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the renormalization effects in \\NCO, we use the LDA band structure as a reference and compare the ARPES Fermi velocities ($v_F^{PES}$)\nto the corresponding LDA values ($v_F^{LDA}$). As it can be observed in Figs.\\,4\\,(a),(b), these two quantities show exactly the opposite behavior:\n$v_F^{PES}$ decreases and $v_F^{LDA}$ increases upon rotation from \\GM\\/ to \\GK.\n%\nIn order to check whether the deviation between ARPES and LDA is related to a lattice distortion at the surface, LDA calculations were performed for\nstructures where the distance between the oxygen and the cobalt layers, i.e. the Co--O--Co bond angle, was changed. In agreement with previous\ncalculations, we observe that the top of the $e_g'$ band is shifted to higher binding energies upon increasing the Co--O--Co bond angle. At the same\ntime the anisotropy of $v_F^{\\rm LDA}$ is slightly reduced, but unchanged qualitatively. This strongly suggests  that the measured anisotropy of\n$v_F^{PES}$ is not caused by a lattice distortion at the surface.\n\n\n The comparison of LDA and ARPES therefore shows that the deviation of the LDA\nbandstructure from the measured QP-dispersion increases dramatically close to the \\GK-direction (cf. inset of Fig.\\,3). In the following we will\nrefer to this deviation as QP-renormalization (QPR).\n%\nThis QPR can be characterized using a constant $\\kappa$ defined by $(1+\\kappa)\\,v_F^{PES}=v_F^{LDA}$. The $\\psi$- or, in other words, k-dependence of\n$\\kappa$ is shown in Fig.\\,4\\,(d), revealing the strong anisotropy of the QPR in \\NCO. We note that, although the photoelectron intensity in\nFig.\\,2\\,(a) at $k_F$ is also influenced by matrix element effects, it is always significantly lower in the \\GK- than in the \\GM-direction, in\nagreement with enhanced renormalization effects along \\GK.\n\n\n\n\nWe find $\\partial_k E^{PES}\\simeq \\partial_k E^{LDA}/2$ along \\GK \\/ in the whole energy range up to $E_B=85$\\,meV (inset of Fig.\\,3).\n%even in the energy range well below $E_d\\simeq\n%26$\\,meV (cf. inset of Fig.\\,3). %i.e. the QP-dispersion is not affected by the coupling to a single bosonic mode alone.\n%\nAt the same time it is remarkable that the QPR gets stronger the closer the so-called $e_g'$-band gets to the Fermi level (c.f. Fig.2\\,(b)). This\npoints to an effect related to coupling between the $a_{1g}$- and the $e_g'$-bands. In fact, a strong interaction between these bands is manifested\nby a large hybridization gap at higher binding energies  and the polarization dependence along \\GK\\/ found in a recent ARPES study \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n%\nHence, the $k$-dependent QPR at $E_F$ is most likely caused by multiorbital effects, i.e. interactions between the states of $e_g'$ and $a_{1g}$\nsymmetry. In this case, the QP-states along \\GM\\/ and \\GK\\/ display different properties: Along \\GM\\/ the QP-states have largely $a_{1g}$ symmetry,\nwhile they display pronounced multiorbital properties along \\GK . This is of crucial importance for the many-body effects in these materials, since\nthe coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations depends critically on the symmetry of the QP-states \\cite{DevereauxPRL04}.\n%\n%Since the coupling of the QP to bosonic excitations depends critically on the symmetry of the QP-states \\cite{DevereauxPRL04}, this might be related\n%to the $k$-dependence of $E_d$ described above.\nTo conclude so far, the observed anisotropies clearly indicate that multiorbital effects play an important role for the QP-dynamics at $E_F$.\n\n\n\n%%% DFT cannot describe vF(psi)\n\nFurthermore, our DFT studies --details will be provided in a forthcoming publication-- show that %, besides the multi-orbital effects,\nmagnetic correlations play an important role for the QP-dynamics as well: According to non-magnetic LDA calculations the band structure of \\NCOc\\/\ndisplays a strong 3D character. In agreement with a previous DFT study \\cite{JohannesEPL04}, we obtain a sizeable $k_z$-dispersion parallel to the\n$c$-axis that leads to additional caps of the FS as shown in Figs.\\,5\\,(a),(b). Such a strong 3D character is not in agreement with ARPES data: (i)\nin general, the QP peaks at $E_F$ are expected to be considerably broadened in a 3D system, in particular because the short life time of the final\nstates becomes important \\cite{StarnbergPRB93}. This is not the case (Fig.\\,1). (ii) ARPES measurements at various excitation energies do not show\nany evidence for a strong dispersion along $c$ \\cite{QianPRL06b}.\n\nHowever, magnetic LSDA calculations yield an AFM ground state, where ferromagnetic $ab$-planes are coupled antiferromagnetically along $c$. This\nagrees well with neutron data \\cite{HelmePRL05}. In the AFM state, the $k_z$-dispersion is strongly reduced, which removes the aforementioned FS-caps\nand yields the FS shown in Fig.\\,5\\,(c). In other words, according to LSDA, 3D AFM correlations\n%at low temperatures\nrender the electronic structure of \\NCOc\\/ effectively 2D. The top of the $e_g'$-band at $E_B\\simeq 70$\\,meV as well as the topology and size of the\nFS obtained in LSDA are in good agreement with the ARPES data as demonstrated in 5\\,(d). The above results together with the neutron data indicate\nthat AFM correlations have a strong influence on the electronic structure of \\NCOx\\/ with $x\\simeq0.75$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the QPR in \\NCO \\/ is strongly anisotropic and provided clear evidence for the relevance of multiorbital effects\nfor the QP dynamics in this material. In addition, detailed DFT studies highlight the impact of magnetic correlations on the QP-states near $E_F$,\nwhich is expected to be directly related to the unusual temperature as well as the field dependencies of the thermopower and the QP scattering rates\n\\cite{WangNature03,LiPRL04,HasanPRL04}.  Hence, both the interactions between the $a_{1g}$ and $e_g'$ states as well as magnetic correlations have to\nbe taken into account in order to obtain a realistic description of these materials.\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf Acknowledgements:} We thank Dr. Bussy (Univ. of Lausanne) for the micro probe analysis and  I.

For the first time, we\n  self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling,\n  star formation, as well as black hole growth and associated energy feedback\n  processes, starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the\n  $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.  Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on\n  an approach we have recently developed and tested in simulations of isolated\n  galaxy mergers. Here we apply the same model in cosmological simulations to\n  examine: (i) the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly in\n  galaxies, (ii) the evolution of the local black hole-host mass correlations\n  and (iii) the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars,\n  as well\n  as the properties of their hosts and descendants today. We find that our\n  simulations produce a total black hole mass density $\\rho_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 2\n  \\times 10^{5} \\Msun\\Mpc^{-3}$ by $z=0$, \n  in good agreement with observational\n  estimates. The black hole accretion rate density, $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm BH}$,\n  peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the\n  star formation rate density, $\\dot{\\rho}_{*}$, with an approximate scaling\n  as $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm BH}/\\dot{\\rho}_{*} \\propto (1+z)^{-4}$ at $z\\ge3$. On\n  the other hand, the ratio $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*} \\sim (1+z)^{-0.6}$ of\n  black hole to stellar mass densities shows only a moderate evolution at low\n  redshifts $z \\lesssim 3$. For the population of galaxies identified in the\n  simulations at $z=1$ we find strong correlations between black hole mass and\n  velocity dispersion or mass of the stellar systems. The predicted\n  correlations agree well with the measured local $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ and\n  $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relationships, but also suggest a weak evolution with\n  redshift in the normalization, and in particular the slope. However, the\n  magnitude of this effect is sensitive to the range of masses being probed.\n  For\n  stellar masses of $M_{*}\\ge 3\\times 10^{10}$, we predict a trend of\n  increasing $M_{*}/ M_{\\rm BH}$ with redshift, in agreement with recent\n  direct estimates of the BH to host stellar mass ratio at high redshift and\n  the conjecture that a more fundamental relation (a BH fundamental plane)\n  should involve both $M_{*}$ and $\\sigma$.  We find that our simulation\n  models can also produce quite massive black holes at high redshift, as a\n  result of extended periods of exponential growth in relatively isolated,\n  rare regions that collapse early and exhibit strong gas\n  inflows. Interestingly, when followed to their descendants, these first\n  supermassive BH systems are not necessarily the most massive ones today,\n  since they are often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{quasars: general --- galaxies: formation --- galaxies: active --- \ngalaxies: evolution --- cosmology: theory --- hydrodynamics}\n\n\\section{Introduction\\label{sec:intro}}\nFollowing the discovery of quasars \\citep{Schmidt1963, Greenstein1963} it was\nsuggested that supermassive black holes ($10^6-10^9$~\\Msun) lie at the centers\nof galaxies, and that the quasar activity is fueled by the release of\ngravitational energy from their accreted matter. The remnants of quasar phases\nat early times are probably the supermassive black holes found at the centers\nof galaxies in our local Universe. Interestingly, the properties of these\nsupermassive black holes are tightly coupled to the mass \\citep{Magorrian1998}\nand velocity dispersion of their host galaxies, as manifested in the $M_{\\rm\n  BH}-\\sigma$ relation of spheroids \\citep{Ferrarese2000, Gebhardt2000}. In\naddition, the black hole mass is correlated with the concentration or Sersic\nindex \\citep{Graham2006}.  Most recently, \\citet{Hopkins2007a} have shown \nthat these various correlations are not independent, and can be\nunderstood as projections of a ``black hole fundamental plane'' (BHFP),\nsimilar to that describing properties of elliptical galaxies.\n\nThe existence of highly luminous quasars also\nconstrains the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and the epoch of\nreionization. Quasars with inferred black hole masses in excess of\n$10^9$~\\Msun\\ have now been discovered out to $z\\sim 6$ \\citep{Fan2003},\nindicating an early formation time for black holes and galaxy spheroids and\nposing a significant challenge for theoretical models of high-redshift quasar\nand galaxy formation.\n\nThis growing observational evidence, drawn from local galaxies to high\nredshift quasars, argues for a close connection between the formation and\nevolution of galaxies and of their central supermassive black holes. However,\nthe physical nature of this relationship has yet to be understood in detail.\nIndeed, there are significant gaps in our observational and theoretical\nknowledge of the history of black hole formation and evolution in galaxies.\n\nFor example, current velocity dispersion measurements are inconclusive about\nthe important question whether the tight scaling relations evolve with\nredshift \\citep{Woo2006,Shields2006}, or are essentially invariant\n\\citep{Shields2003} as a function of time. We note that some\nevolution in the ratio of black hole to halo mass\nis suggested by clustering constraints \\citep[e.g][]{Adelberger2005,\nLidz2006}, but these measurements do not directly address\nthe relationship between black hole and properties of the\nluminous host galaxy.  More relevant are \ncomparisons of the black hole mass inferred from quasar observations\nto the host stellar mass, both observationally\n\\citep{Merloni2004} and theoretically \\citep{Hopkins2006a},\nwhich indicate an evolution in e.g. the Magorrian relation, in\nthe sense that black holes are more massive relative to luminous\nspheroids at high redshifts than at $z=0$.  \n\nTheoretical studies of the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies have so\nfar mostly used so-called semi-analytical modeling\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Kauffmann2000, Cattaneo1999, Wyithe2003a, Volonteri2003,\nDiMatteo2003, Granato2004, Springel2005c, Cattaneo2005, Croton2006,\nDeLucia2006, Malbon2007} of galaxy formation, in which the growth of\ngalaxies and their embedded black holes is followed with simple physical\nparameterizations on top of dark matter merging history trees. Many of these\nmodels assume that quasar activity is triggered by major galaxy mergers,\nmotivated by hydrodynamical simulations that have shown that gravitational\ntidal fields during major mergers of gas rich galaxies produce strong gas\ninflows \\citep{BarnesHernquist1991, BarnesHernquist1996}, which lead to a\nburst of nuclear star formation \\citep{Mihos1996} and are likely the\nprerequisite for rapid black hole growth and quasar activity.  Nearby quasars\nare indeed preferentially found in tidally disturbed objects\n\\citep[e.g][]{Jogee2004}, corroborating the importance of galaxy interactions\nand mergers for major black hole growth.\n\nMany theoretical explanations for the observed correlations between galaxy\nproperties and black hole mass rely on some form of self-regulated growth of\nthe BHs. For example, it has been suggested that the central black holes grow\nuntil they release sufficient energy to unbind the gas that feeds them from\ntheir host galaxy \\citep{CiottiOstriker1997, Silk1998, Fabian1999,\nWyithe2003a}. We recently explored such a local energy feedback for the first\ntime with self-consistent, fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxies \\citep{DiMatteo2005,Springel2005a} that include a treatment of\naccretion on supermassive black holes and their associated energy\nfeedback. These simulations have demonstrated that the fundamental BH-host\ncorrelation including the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation can indeed be\nreproduced in feedback-regulated models of BH growth \\citep{DiMatteo2005}, in\naccordance with theoretical conjectures. At the same time, the dynamical\ncoupling in the simulations of hydrodynamical gas inflow, star formation,\nblack hole growth and associated feedback processes gives them substantial\npredictive power well beyond that of simplified analytical and semi-analytical\nmodels. Besides the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ or $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Robertson2006a} relationships, the simulation models can\nfor example predict the detailed properties of the spheroidal galaxies forming\nin major mergers and how they correlate with the BH masses. In fact, they\nsuggest the existence of a fundamental plane relation for BHs ($M_{BH} \\propto\n\\sigma^{3.0} R_e^{0.5}$ \\citep{Hopkins2007a}, provide an explanation for the\nred colors of massive elliptical galaxies \\citep{Springel2005b}, and\ndescribe the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies \\citep{Robertson2006b}.\nThey also suggest luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes, leading to a new\ninterpretation for the origin of the quasar luminosity function and its\nevolution over cosmic history~\\citep{Hopkins2005, Hopkins2006a}.\n\nIn the present paper, we extend these earlier studies by carrying out fully\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the $\\Lambda$CDM model that jointly\nfollow the growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes, as well as their\nassociated feedback processes. Our approach is based on the same methodology\nthat we have developed and applied in the high-resolution simulations of\ngalaxy mergers, augmented with a suitable mechanism to seed emerging new dark\nmatter halos with a small black hole that can then grow by gas accretion later\non. While much more restricted in numerical resolution than simulations of\nindividual galaxy mergers, our modeling of star formation and black hole\nphysics in terms of a sub-resolution treatment provides quite accurate results\nalready at comparatively coarse resolution, an important prerequisite for\nattempting to model these processes in cosmological simulations. Nevertheless,\nnumerical resolution is clearly an important limitation of our cosmological\nresults, an aspect that we will discuss in more detail where appropriate. With\nthis caveat in mind, we would like to stress however that the unambiguous\ninitial conditions of direct cosmological simulation make them in principle\nthe most powerful and accurate tool for studying the interplay of galaxy\nformation and black hole growth.  Our aim is therefore to examine how well our\ncurrent model for treating BH physics in simulations does in present\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations of cosmic structure formation,\nand what we can learn from them to advance our theoretical understanding of\nthe co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. In this study we\nshall focus on basic properties of the black hole population, like the\nevolution of the cosmic BH mass density, and the correlations between BH\nmasses and host galaxy properties. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we also study an\nextension of our feedback model with a `radio mode' that is active at low\naccretion rates and is distinct from the normal quasar activity, allowing us\nto study the formation of AGN in rich galaxy clusters at low redshifts, where\nit is likely to be important.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows.  In \\S2 we describe our simulation set\nand the numerical modeling adopted for the ISM, star formation and gas\naccretion onto black holes. In \\S3 we present our results for the evolution of\nthe global black hole mass density and compare it to the cosmic history of\nstar formation and the evolution of the stellar density.  In \\S4 we examine our\nresults for the fundamental BH/host correlations measured from the simulation\nand for their evolution from high to low redshift. Finally, we summarize and\ndiscuss our findings in \\S5.\n\n\\section{Methodology\\label{sec:method}}\n\n\\subsection{Numerical code}\nIn this study we focus on a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with parameters\nchosen according to the first year results from the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe \\citep[WMAP1;][] {Spergel2003}, $\\Omega_0 = 0.3$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.7$, Hubble constant $H_0 = 100 h \\kmpspMpc$ with $h\n=0.7$ and a scale invariant primordial power spectrum with index $n=1$, with a\nnormalization of the amplitude of fluctuations $\\sigma_{8} = 0.9$.\n\\footnote{The largest simulation presented here had already been started by\n  the time the updated third year constraints have become available\n  \\citep[WMAP3;][]{Spergel2006}. We comment on effects on the growth of the\n  halo mass function owing to the lower amplitude of fluctuations, $\\sigma_{8}$\n  implied by WMAP3 in ~\\citet{Li2007, Sijacki2007}}. We use a significantly\n  extended version of the parallel cosmological TreePM-SPH code {\\small\n  GADGET2}~\\citep{Springel2005d} to evolve a realization of $\\Lambda$CDM\n  initial conditions from high to low redshift. The combination of a\n  high-resolution gravitational solver with individual and adaptive timesteps\n  allows this code to bridge a large dynamic range both in length- and\n  timescales.  Gas dynamics is followed with the Lagrangian smoothed particle\n  hydrodynamics (SPH)~\\citep[e.g] []{Monaghan1992} technique, which we employ\n  in a formulation that manifestly conserves energy and entropy, despite the\n  use of fully adaptive SPH smoothing lengths~\\citep{Springel2002}.  Radiative\n  cooling and heating processes are computed as in \\citet{Katz1996}, with a\n  spatially uniform photoionizing UV background that is imposed externally.\n\nWithin cosmological (or galaxy-sized) numerical simulations, it is presently\n(and for some time to come) not feasible to follow the physics of star\nformation and black hole accretion from first principles down to scales of\nindividual stars or black holes.  Any numerical model of galaxy formation\ntherefore needs to make substantial approximations for some of the relevant\nphysics on unresolved scales.\n\n\nFor modeling star formation and its associated supernova feedback we use the\nsub-resolution multiphase model for the interstellar medium developed by\n\\citet{Springel2003a}. In this model, a thermal instability is assumed to\noperate above a critical density threshold $\\rho_{\\rm th}$, producing a two\nphase medium consisting of cold clouds embedded in a tenuous gas at pressure\nequilibrium. Stars form from the cold clouds, and short-lived stars supply an\nenergy of $10^{51}\\,{\\rm ergs}$ to the surrounding gas as supernovae. This\nenergy heats the diffuse phase of the ISM and evaporates cold clouds, thereby\nestablishing a self-regulation cycle for star formation.  $\\rho_{\\rm th}$ is\ndetermined self-consistently in the model by requiring that the equation of\nstate (EOS) is continuous at the onset of star formation. The cloud\nevaporation process and the cooling function of the gas then determine the\ntemperatures and the mass fractions of the two hot and cold phases of the\nISM, such that the EOS of the model can be directly computed as a function of\ndensity. The latter is encapsulating the self-regulated nature of star\nformation owing to supernovae feedback in a simple model for a multiphase ISM.\nAs in the \\citet{Springel2003a} model we have included a model\nfor supernova-driven galactic winds with an initial wind speed of $v \\sim 480\n\\kmps$.\n\nFor the parameter settings adopted here, the model reproduces the observed\nstar formation rate surface densities in isolated spiral\ngalaxies~\\citep{Kennicutt1989, Kennicutt1998}. Using a large number of nested\ncosmological simulations, the approach we adopt (and the parameters we use)\nhas also been shown to lead to a numerically converged estimate\nfor the cosmic star formation history of the universe that agrees reasonably\nwell with low redshift observations \\citep{Springel2003b,Hernquist2003}.\nFor the modeling\nof BH accretion and feedback we adopt a similar strategy as for star\nformation, which we discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Accretion and Feedback from Supermassive black holes}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1a.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1b.ps}}\\\\\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1c.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1d.ps}}\\\\\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1e.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{7.6cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f1f.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Projected baryonic density field in slices of thickness\n$5000\\,h^{-1}\\kpc$ through our high resolution simulation, color-coded\nby temperature and with brightness proportional to the logarithm of\nthe gas density.

The circles mark the positions of\nthe black holes, with a size that encodes the BH mass, as indicated in\nthe top left panel.}\n\\label{fig:D6slices}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs for star formation, we adopt a sub-resolution model to capture the main\nfeatures of accretion and associated feedback on supermassive black holes\n\\citep[as introduced in][]{Springel2005a, DiMatteo2005}.  To this end, we\nrepresent black holes by collisionless `sink' particles that can grow in mass\nby accreting gas from their immediate environments, or by merging with other\nblack holes. We estimate the gas accretion rate onto a black hole using a\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton parameterization \\citep{Bondi1952, BondiHoyle1944,\nHoyle1939}. In this description, the accretion rate onto the black hole is\ngiven by $\\dot{M}_{\\rm B} \\, = \\, {{4\\pi \\, \\, [G^2 M_{\\rm BH}^2 \\, \\rho}] /\n{(c_s^2 + v^2)^{3/2}}} \\, $ where $\\rho$, $c_s$ are the density and sound\nspeed of the ISM gas, respectively, and $v$ is the velocity of the black hole\nrelative to the surrounding gas. In this study we also allow the black hole to\naccrete at mildly super-Eddington values and impose a maximum allowed\naccretion rate equal to $2x$ Eddington rate, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$. As we shall\nsee such conditions are generally achieved at high redshift.  We note that the\ndetailed relativistic accretion flow onto the black hole is {\\em unresolved}\nin our simulations, but if the limitating factor for rapid growth of BHs lies\nin the larger-scale gas distribution around the black hole, {\\em which is\nresolved}, then the Bondi prescription should capture the dependence of the\nmean accretion rate onto the conditions of the gas in the region around the\nblack hole.\n\nThe radiated luminosity, $L_{\\rm r}$ is related to the gas accretion rate,\n$\\dot {M}_{\\rm BH}$, by the radiative efficiency $ \\eta \\, = \\, {{L_{\\rm\nr}}/({\\dot {M}_{\\rm BH} \\, c^2}}) \\,$, which simply gives the mass to energy\nconversion efficiency, set by the amount of energy that can be extracted from\nthe innermost stable orbit of an accretion disk around a black hole. We will\nadopt a fixed value of $\\epsilon_{\\rm r} =0.1$, which is the mean value for a\nradiatively efficient \\citep{Shakura1973} accretion disk onto a Schwarzschild\nblack hole.\n\nWe assume that some small fraction $\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$ of the radiated\nluminosity $L_{\\rm r}$ can couple to the surrounding gas in the form of\nfeedback energy, viz. $ \\dot{E}_{\\rm feed} \\, = \\, \\epsilon_{\\rm f} \\, L_{\\rm\n  r}$\n% \\,\\, = \\, \\epsilon_{\\rm f} \\, 0.1 \\, \\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} \\,\n%c^2 \\, $. \nIn accordance with our previous studies of galaxy merger simulations we take\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm f} = 5 \\% $.  This value governs the normalization of the\n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation, and $\\epsilon_{\\rm f} = 5 \\% $ brings it into\nagreement with current observations \\citep{DiMatteo2005}. We note that\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$ is effectively the only free parameter in our black hole\nmodel. After fixing it to reproduce the normalization of the observed $M_{\\rm\n  BH} - \\sigma$ from the galaxy models we do not vary it in any of our\ncosmological simulations.\n\nFor simplicity, we deposit the feedback energy isotropically in the region\naround the black hole.  Lack of spatial resolution precludes us from\nconsidering mechanical modes of releasing the energy, e.g.~in the form of a\njet. However, we note that is is plausible that such other forms of energy are\nthermalized eventually as well, and that the final impact of the feedback\ndepends primarily on the total amount of energy released and less on the form\nit is released in.  This is likely to be true generally, provided that\nthe energy (or momentum) is imparted to the surrounding gas on length\nscales small and time scales short compared with those that characterize\nthe host galaxy.  In that event, the impact of black hole feedback will\nbe explosive in nature and, indeed, the blowout phase of evolution in\nour simulations is well-described by a generalized Sedov-Taylor\nblast-wave solution \\citep{Hopkins2006b,HH2006}.\nIn any case, we emphasize that despite an isotropic release of the energy,\nthe response of the gas can still be decidedly anisotropic, e.g.~when a dense\ngas disk is present that channels the gas response into a collimated outflow.\n\nThe idea that we follow with our feedback modeling here is the rapid\naccretion phases of BHs at times close to their critical growth phases. Such\n`quasar' phases are typically relatively short-lived and require galaxy\nmergers to produce the strong gravitational tidal forcing necessary for\nsufficient nuclear gas inflow rates. It is presently unclear whether the\naccretion disks in such modes actually produce mechanical jets of release\ntheir feedback in another way. It is however evident that at low redshift\n(e.g.; $z < 1$ which we are not studying directly here) that when BHs that are\nembedded in the hot gas atmospheres of large groups and clusters channel their\nenergy in mechanical feedback in the form of relativistic jets, generating\nbuoyantly rising radio bubble. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we consider this form\nof feedback mode.\n\n%This assumption is physically reasonable, and there is not likely\n%to be a feasible alternative at present.\n%Our understanding of the physics of accretion and how it couples to\n%jets/outflows from supermassive black holes is sufficiently poor that it\n%is not clear what range in spatial scales would be required to obtain\n%a complete description of the impact of black hole growth and feedback\n%on galactic scales. Even state-of-the-art 3-D numerical calculations\n%of individual accretion disks with magneto-rotational instability and\n%full-GR treatment \\citep{reference} currently need to be carried out\n%under quite restrictive assumptions (e.g., they are typically\n%non-radiative).\n\nAn important remaining question in our model concerns the ultimate origin of\nthe BHs. Since our accretion rate estimate can only grow a BH that already\nexists, we assume that a physical process that produces small seed BHs is\noperating sufficiently efficiently that effectively all halos above a certain\nthreshold mass contain at least one such seed BH. Whether or not they can then\ngrow to larger masses by gas accretion will be determined by the local gas\nconditions, as described in our model above. In order to achieve such a\nseeding at a technical level in cosmological runs we use an on-the-fly\n`friends-of-friends' group finder algorithm which is called at intervals\nequally spaced in the logarithm of the scale-factor $a$, with $\\Delta \\log{a} =\n\\log{1.25}$. This provides the locations and mass of all halos in the\nsimulation. If a halo is more massive than our threshold and does not contain\nany black hole yet, we endow it with one by converting its densest gas\nparticle into a sink particle with a seed black hole mass of $10^5\\, h^{-1}\n\\Msun$.  The further growth of the black hole sink can then proceed by gas\naccretion, at a rate that depends sensitively on the local conditions, or by\nmergers with other black hole sink particles.  The total cumulative black hole\nmass introduced in this way as seeds is negligible compared to the mass growth\nby gas accretion. We note that being able to run a fast, parallel\n`friends-of-friends' algorithm on the fly during simulations is an important\ntechnical prerequisite of our technique.\n\nFurther motivation for this choice of seeding procedure is based on the\ncurrently proposed scenarios for the seed black holes in galaxies. To grow a\nsupermassive black hole to a mass of $\\sim 10^{9} \\Msun$ in less than a\nbillion years, as required by presence of the $z=6$ SDSS quasars, may require\n(1) the catastrophic collapse of a supermassive star that forms a large\ninitial black hole of mass $10^4-10^6\\Msun$ \\citep{Carr1984, Bromm2003,\nBegelman2006}, or (2) alternatively, smaller black hole seeds ($M \\sim 10^2\n\\Msun$) may form from the first PopIII stars at $z \\sim 30$ and grow\nexponentially from then on \\citep{Abel2002, Bromm2004, Yoshida2006}.\nIn our simulations,\nblack hole seeds of mass $M=10^5 \\,h^{-1}\\Msun$ are introduced into galaxies\nas they initially reach $M_{\\rm halo} = 10^{10}\\,h^{-1} \\Msun$.  This choice\nis a good approximation to what is expected for both of the hypotheses\noutlined above.  For (1) this is roughly in the correct range; whereas for (2)\nEddington growth predicts that the black hole has grown to roughly these\nvalues by the time of collapse of $M \\sim 10^{10}h^{-1} \\Msun$ perturbations,\nwhich occurs at $z \\sim 10$ in our standard cold dark matter scenario.\nAdditionally, although not required, this value of the initial black hole mass\nto galaxy ratio fits the observed relations at low redshift\n\\citep{Magorrian1998, Ferrarese2000}. It is important to note that the\ndominant growth of black holes always occurs in exponential Eddington phases\ninduced by gas accretion so that our results are rather insensitive to the\nspecific choice of the seed mass.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Numerical parameters of cosmological simulations with BHs}\n\\label{tab:simul}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\nRun  &  Boxsize & $N_{p}$ & $m_{\\rm DM}$ & $m_{\\rm gas}$ & $\\epsilon$& $z_{\\rm en\nd}$ \\\\\n     &  $h^{-1}$Mpc &&  $h^{-1} \\Msun$ &$h^{-1} \\Msun$ &  $h^{-1}$ kpc &  \\\\\n\\hline\n  D4 & 33.75 & $2\\times 216^3$& $2.75 \\times 10^{8}$ & $4.24 \\times 10^{7}$  & 6.25\n& 0.00 \\\\\nD6 ({\\it BHCosmo}) & 33.75 & $2\\times 486^3$& $2.75\\times 10^{7}$ &  $4.24\\times 10^{6}$&\n2.73 & 1.00 \\\\\nE6 & 50 & $2\\times 486^3$& $7.85\\times 10^{7}$ &  $1.21\\times 10^{7}$&\n4.12 & 4.00 \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\nWhen galaxies and their surrounding dark halos merge to form a single dark\nmatter halo, their central black holes are also expected to merge eventually,\nso hierarchical black hole mergers contribute to the growth of the central\nblack holes.  Whether the forming black hole binaries can really coalesce\nefficiently is however a matter of debate.  In a stellar environment, it has\nbeen argued that the binary hardens only very slowly \\citep{Begelman1980,\nMilosav2003}, while in gaseous environments binaries may coalesce rapidly\nowing to strong dynamical friction with the gas \\citep{Makino2004,\nEscala2004}. In our galaxy-sized simulations, and even more so in the\ncosmological boxes, it is not possible to treat in detail the problem of\nbinary hardening, nor to directly calculate the ejection of black holes by\ngravitational recoil, or by three-body sling-shot ejection of black holes in\ntriple systems.  Because galaxies have typically large central concentrations\nof gas we instead assume that two black hole particles merge quickly if they\ncome within the spatial resolution of the simulation and their relative speed\nlies below the gas sound speed. In practice, this means that two sink\nparticles that fulfill these conditions are merged into a single BH particle,\nwith their masses combined.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{16.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f2.eps}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Three level zooms into the simulation region marked by the white\nrectangle in the $z=3$ panel of Fig~\\ref{fig:D6slices}.

This is\na substantial challenge, given that the brightest quasars at $z\\sim 6$ have a\nlow space density and are believed to reside in fairly massive dark matter\nhalos of mass $M\\sim 10^{11}-10^{12} \\Msun$, or even larger.  \nAt redshifts $z=2-3$, quasars\nhave a much larger space density, comparable to $L^{*}$ galaxies at $z=0$.\n\nThe strategy we choose here is model the universe with a periodic box of\nmoderate size $33.75\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ that is homogeneously sampled with\nparticles, and which we simulate with $2\\times 486^3$ particles, one of the\n{\\it highest resolutions} so far achieved in a full cosmological\nhydrodynamical calculation of galaxy formation. In this paper, we refer to\nthis largest simulation among our simulation set as the {\\it BHCosmo} run.  We\nwill also compare it with two additional simulations which differ in mass and\nspatial resolution, and/or box size, to test for resolution effects.\n\n\nThe fundamental numerical parameters of our simulation runs are listed in\nTable~\\ref{tab:simul}, where $N_p$ is the number of dark matter and gas\nparticles, $m_{\\rm DM}$ and $m_{\\rm gas}$ are their masses (initial mass in\nthe case of the gas). Finally, $\\epsilon $ gives the comoving gravitational\nsoftening length, and $z_{\\rm end}$ the final redshift of the simulation.\n\n\nFor the physical problem at hand we prefer relatively high resolution in order\nto capture the physics in high density regions appropriately, but we also need\na large volume to study the growth of deep gravitational potentials. Our\nchoice of $33.75\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ represents a compromise in this respect.\nWhile this box-size is too small to be evolved to redshifts lower than\n$z\\simeq 1$ (otherwise the fundamental mode would become non-linear), it is\nsufficiently large to provide a representative model for $L_\\star$-objects at\nhigher redshift, even though very rare systems in the exponential tail of the\nmass function will not be sampled well.  We also note that the choice of\nbox-size and particle number in the {\\it BHCosmo} run is such that the\nphysical resolution at $z\\sim 6$ is comparable to that in some of our previous\nworks on galaxy mergers, namely runs which used only $N\\simeq 10000$ particles\nfor each galaxy. In this prior work, we have shown that despite the low\nresolution the results for the black hole mass growth agreed well with those\nobtained in runs with 128 times higher resolution, and can therefore be\nconsidered converged with respect to this quantity. This overlap in\nresolution between our cosmological runs and our previous work on isolated\ngalaxy mergers gives us confidence that the results of our cosmological runs\nare not dominated by resolution effects, although it is clear that this needs\nto be tested separately.  We remark that as part of our previous work on\nmergers we have run a suite of several hundred galaxy merger simulations\n\\citep{Robertson2006a}, varying all the parameters describing star formation\nand feedback from supernovae and black hole growth and accretion, besides\ncarrying out numerical resolution studies. The galaxy merger simulations are\nclearly much better suited for investigating the full parameter space of our\nmodel, while for the cosmological runs we have to restrict ourselves to our\ndefault model owing to their much larger computational cost.\n\nIn addition to the above considerations, the choice of box-size in our new\nsimulations is also motivated by the set of simulations presented in\n\\citet{Springel2003b}. In fact, the {\\it BHCosmo} run would be called `D6' in\ntheir naming scheme. Being able to directly refer to their runs simplifies the\ncomparison of the physical properties of simulations with and without black\nholes, e.g.~with respect to the star formation history.\n\n%\\subsection{Convergence}\n\n%{\\bf (still missing subsection)}\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\\subsection{Visualization of the structure and black hole growth}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:D6slices}, we show slices through the {\\it BHCosmo}\nsimulation at a range of redshifts in order to visualize the evolution of the\nbaryonic density field and the growth of black holes.  The slice has a\nthickness of $5\\,h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc}$ and shows the full box of size $33.75\\,\nh^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on a side. In each panel, the projected gas density field is\ncolor-coded according to the gas temperature, with the brightness of each\npixel being proportional to the logarithm of the gas surface density. Circles\nof different size are drawn to mark the locations of BHs of different mass, as\nlabelled.\n\nThe images show that black holes emerge in halos starting at high redshift (as\nearly as $z\\sim 12$) and subsequently grow by gas accretion, driven by gas\ninflows that accompany the hierarchical build-up of ever larger halos through\nmerging. As the simulation evolves, the number of black holes rapidly\nincreases and larger halos host increasingly more massive black holes.  We\nnote that the particular slice of the box shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6slices}\ndoes not contain the largest black hole in the simulation's volume, which turns\nout to be located in the highest density region in the simulation.  We will\ndiscuss this region separately in later sections.\n\nBy plotting the density field color-coded by temperature we can also see\ntraces of heating effects from strong gas outflows, which are caused by black\nhole feedback and galactic winds from star formation. In our numerical mode,\nquasar-driven outflows occur once a central BH gas grown so much that its\nenergy feedback in accretion phases is able to transfer sufficient energy to\nthe remaining gas to unbind and expel part of it from the galaxy potential as\na wind. This then terminates further strong growth of the BH, which is key\nfactor in establishing a self-regulated nature of the growth of black holes in\nour model, as we discussed in detail in our previous work on galaxy merger\nsimulations.\n\nTo illustrate how well the mass resolution of the simulation captures details\nof galaxy formation sites, we zoom in onto a region of $6\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on\na side at $z=3$ (as indicated by the box drawn in Fig~\\ref{fig:D6slices}),\nshowing the gas density in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsgas}, and the stellar\ndensity of the same region in Figure~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsstars}. The middle\npanels (labeled B) in both figures show a second zoom-level into a region of\n$2\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ on a side (indicated by the square in the A panels).\nFinally, the top panels show a further enlargement by a factor of 8.\n\nIn accordance with our seeding procedure, black holes are located in the\nhighest density regions. The more massive ones are found within the largest\nhalos, which have also undergone more prominent star formation. Such a\ncorrespondence is expected in our model since large-scale gas inflows into the\ncenters of halos lead both to star formation (and starbursts) as well as to\nnuclear black hole growth. In the highest level zoom of\nFigures~\\ref{fig:D6zoomsgas} and \\ref{fig:D6zoomsstars}, the central galaxy,\nwith an extent of $\\sim50h^{-1} {\\rm kpc}$ (comoving), has a very rough \ndisk-like morphology with a central stellar bulge.\nNevertheless, it is clear that our cosmological simulations in general still\nhave too low resolution for properly resolving galaxy morphologies. We also\nnote that producing disk galaxies with the right size and abundance in\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations is an essentially unsolved problem,\nand the outlook for obtaining a solution to this long-standing challenge has\nonly slightly improved by recent works on disk galaxy formation\n\\citep{Robertson2004, Governato2007, Okamoto2007}.\n%For our simulations, this implies that\n%they cannot be expected to be able to accurately resolve large amounts of cold\n%gas in centrifugal support in thin, gas-rich spirals. This probably leads to\n%inaccuracies in the detailed growth history of our central BHs.  Instead of\n%being `parked' at large radii until the final coalescence of two galaxies in a\n%major merger, the gas will be fed prematurely to the nuclei in our runs,\n%washing out some of the details of the time evolution of the merging systems.\n%However, our resolution tests demonstrate that even under conditions of very\n%poor resolution, quasar activity is triggered by mergers in a robust way and\n%the BH grows to the right final mass expected for the velocity dispersion of\n%the spheroid. \n\n\\subsection{The evolution of the global black hole mass density}\nThe black hole mass density at the present epoch is estimated from direct\nmeasurements of black hole masses in local galaxies (to establish, e.g., the\n$M_{\\rm BH}-M_\\star$ relationship), combined with a suitable integration over\nthe galaxy luminosity function ~\\citep{Fabian1999, YuTremaine2002,\nMarconi2004}. The local value thus obtained matches that of the total relic BH\nmass density estimated from a time integration of the luminosity output of\nactive galactic nuclei and quasars at X-ray and optical wavelengths\n\\citep{Soltan1982, Marconi2004, Shankar2004}, or in a less model-dependent\nmanner from an empirical determination of the bolometric quasar\nluminosity function \\citep{Hopkins2007b}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace*{-0.5cm}\\vspace*{-1.0cm}\\\\\n \\resizebox{9.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f4.ps}}\n\\caption{{\\it Top panel}: The global black hole mass density evolution in the\n{\\it BHCosmo}/D5 run, shown by a solid line.

Most of the black hole and stellar\nmass is assembled by $z\\sim 2-3$, but the peak in the BHAR density function is\nfar more pronounced than that of the SFR density. }\n    \\label{fig:D6acc_den}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} shows our simulation prediction for the global\ndensity $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ and its evolution with redshift ({\\it thick black\n  line}). We find that the normalization of the black hole mass density is in\nagreement with the observational estimate of $\\rho_{\\rm BH} (0) =\n4.6^{+1.9}_{-1.4} \\times 10^{5} h_{0.7}^2 \\Msun \\Mpc^{-3}$ of\n\\citet{Marconi2004} and its extrapolation to $z\\sim 3$, derived by exploiting\nhard X-ray and optically selected AGNs and quasars.  The grey area in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} shows the region delimited by observational\nconstraints examined in detail in the literature \\citep[e.g][]{Salucci1999,\n  Marconi2004, Shankar2004}. The agreement we see here is very reassuring.  It\nshows that our black hole accretion and feedback model in the {\\it BHCosmo}\nrun is adequate and provides a realistic account for the dominant mode of\nglobal black hole growth in our universe.\n\nThe black hole mass density evolves rapidly at high redshift, increasing by\nfour orders of magnitude between $z \\sim 10$ to $z \\sim 3$. While below this\nredshift, there is some further growth, it only accounts for roughly a\ndoubling of the BH density down to $z= 1$. This is corroborated by the bottom\npanel of Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}, where we plot the history of the global\nblack hole accretion rate (BHAR) density in our {\\it BHCosmo} run. It is\nevident that the black hole mass growth occurs mainly by accretion above $z\n\\sim 3$.  Indeed, the BHAR density rises steadily at early times to a peak at\n$z \\sim 3$, where it reaches a value $ \\sim 10^{-4} \\Msun \\yr^{-1} \\Mpc^{-3}$.\nBelow this redshift, it drops rather rapidly, becoming more than an order of\nmagnitude lower by $z= 1$.  We note that the 'spike' seen in the BHAR density\nat $z \\simeq 6.5$ is caused by a single object in the box, namely the rapid\nformation of the most massive black hole in the simulation at this epoch. We\nwill discuss the history of the corresponding halo and its embedded black hole\nin more detail in \\S 5.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-1cm}\n      \\resizebox{10.cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[width=4.in]{f5.ps}}\n    \\caption{The evolution of the black hole mass function in the {\\it\nBHCosmo} run.

We find that the final black hole mass function\nin our simulation (for $z=1$) is is quite good agreement with the one measured\nlocally, especially on the high-mass side. The $z=0$ constraint is indicated\nby the {\\em dark grey area} taken from the compilation of \\citet{Marconi2004},\nwhich is based on a combination of different observational data\n\\citep{kochanek2001, Nakamura2003, Bernardi2003, Sheth2003}. There is a small\ndeficit in our model at intermediate BH masses, but note that this will be\nfilled in at least partly by the expected residual growth from $z=1$ to $z=0$.\nThe {\\em light grey area} adds an additional constraint for the contribution\nof relic AGN, derived from an integration of the the hard X-ray luminosity\nfunction \\citep{Shankar2004}.  (Note that in this latter case the\nnormalization of the mass function depends on the value assumed for the\nradiative efficiency when converting from the luminosity function to the mass\nfunction.)\n \n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f7.ps}} %\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f7a.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n    \\caption{An illustration of a large group in the {\\it BHCosmo} run at\n$z=1$.  {\\it Left panel:} the gas density distribution. {\\it Right\npanel:} the stellar distribution.

However, it is\ninteresting that the mass function for high masses grows rather rapidly at\nearly times relative to the low mass end.  On the other hand, for redshifts $z\n\\lesssim 2$, the high mass end is virtually fully assembled while the BH mass\nfunction continues to grow for low to intermediate masses, leading effectively\nto a steepening of the mass function for $z \\simlt 3$.  This appears\nconsistent with the emerging observational picture of the evolution of the\nsupermassive black hole population according to which massive BHs ($M_{\\rm BH}\n\\simgt 10^9 \\Msun$) are assembled early and are then likely undergoing\ncomparatively passive evolution in the centers of large spheroids\n\\citep{Shields2003, Vestergaard2004, Adelberger2005}. More generally, this\nphenomenon is described by the idea of an `anti-hierarchical' black hole\ngrowth, or equivalently a `downsizing' of black hole activity\n\\citep{Merloni2004, Marconi2004}, which is derived from constraints on the\naccretion history from X-ray luminosity functions.\n\n%Intermediate mass BHs ($7.0 \\lesssim \\log\n%(M_{\\rm BH} / M_{\\sun}) \\lesssim 8.3$) in the mass function undergoing their\n%most significant evolution below $z\\sim 2$. The growth of the mass function in\n%this regime, contributes also to the slow climb of the black hole mass density\n%(Fig.~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} below $z \\sim 2$. The formation of the most massive\n%black holes (and spheroids) provides the dominant contribution to the global\n%black hole mass density.\n\nFinally, in Figure~\\ref{fig:bhaf}, we show the evolution of the corresponding\naccretion rate distribution function for the black holes in our simulation,\nexpressed in units of the Eddington rate. This function is strongly peaked at\na few percent below the critical Eddington value, with most black holes\naccreting at $10^{-2} \\lesssim \\mdot/\\mdot_{\\rm Edd} \\lesssim 1 $ at redshifts\n$z\\simgt 6$. The distribution becomes wider and develops a small amplitude\ntail at low Eddington rates for $ 6 < z < 3$.  Below $z \\sim 3$ the peak of\nthe accretion rate function shifts to $\\mdot/\\mdot_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 10^{-2} -\n10^{-3}$ and an increasingly large population of sources is present accreting\ndown to $10^{-6}$ Eddington. At $z\\sim 1$ the distribution function is\nextremely wide and dominated by sub-Eddington (to severely sub-Eddington)\nsources, in terms of number. While hence the number of sources accreting at\nsub-Eddington rates increases sharply with decreasing redshift, the\nquasar-like population, i.e.~the sources accreting close to Eddington,\ndecreases with decreasing redshift, with a maximum at $z\\sim 3$.  For $z\\sim\n1$, we also include in Figure~\\ref{fig:bhaf} measurements of the separate\ncontributions to the accretion rate function from three different black hole\nmass ranges.  The dotted line gives the Eddington ratio distribution for\n$M_{\\rm BH} > 10^{8} \\Msun$, and the dash-dotted and dot-dot-dashed lines\nare for masses $10^7 < M_{\\rm BH}/\\Msun \\le 10^{8}$ and $10^6 \\leq M_{\\rm\nBH}/\\Msun <10^{7}$, respectively.\n\nTaken together, the evolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate\nfunctions implies that most massive black holes assemble early and do so at\nclose to their critical rate. At low redshift, progressively lower\nluminosities and lower mass systems start dominating the black hole activity.\nThis is in accord with recent results from studies of the hard X-ray\nluminosity function of quasars and AGN, e.g.~typical Seyfert-like objects with\n$M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^7 - 10^8 \\Msun$ accreting at a few percent of the\nEddington rate~\\citep[e.g.][]{Ueda2003, Hasinger2005}.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison of the histories of black hole growth and star formation}In Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}, we have already shown and discussed the\nevolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate densities. In the\nsame Figure, we show corresponding results for the evolution of the\nstellar mass density, $\\rho_{*}$, and the star formation rate (SFR)\ndensity, with their normalizations rescaled by factors of $7\\times\n10^{-3}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively, for plotting purposes. For\ncomparison, we also include results for the D5 simulation of\n\\citet{Springel2003b} which did not include black holes and any\nassociated accretion or feedback processes (dotted grey lines).\n\nWe can see that $\\rho_{*}$ far exceeds $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ at all redshifts, with\n$\\rho_{*}$ evolving less strongly with redshift than $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ for $z\n\\simgt 3$. At early times, $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ rises more rapidly than the star\nformation density, while it tracks its evolution below this redshift. If we\nparameterize the ratio of $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\rho_{*}$ by an evolutionary factor\n$(1+z)^{\\alpha}$ we find that its evolution is approximately given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\rho_{*} \\sim \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\phi_{3} (1+z)^{-3} & \\mbox{if $z \\ge\n3.5$} \\nonumber \\\\ & \\\\ \\phi_1 [(1+z)]^{-0.6} & \\mbox{if $z <\n3.5$}\n\\end{array} \\right. , \\label{eq:rho}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $\\phi_{3} = 5 \\times 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\phi_{1}=2.2\\times10^{-3}$. Accordingly, up to $z\\sim 3$, the evolution of\nthe star formation rate density is considerably shallower than that of the\nblack hole accretion rate density. Below this redshift, the BHAR and SFR\ndensities closely track each other.  As a result, the BHAR density has much\nmore pronounced peak, which we find to lie at slightly lower redshift than the\npeak of the SFR. Parameterizing the evolution of the BHAR and SFR density\nratio with a power law in $(1+z)$ leads to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{\\rho_{BH}} / \\dot{\\rho}_{*} \\sim\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\dot{\\rho}_{3} (1+z)^{-4} & \\mbox{if $z \\ge\n3$} \\nonumber \\\\ & \\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_1 [(1+z)]^{-0.1} & \\mbox{if $z <\n3$}\n\\end{array} \\right. , \\label{eq:drho}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $\\dot{\\phi}_{3} = 0.2$ and $\\dot{\\phi}_{1} = 10^{-3}$. \n\nNote that Equations~(\\ref{eq:rho}) and (\\ref{eq:drho}) are only meant to\nprovide approximate scalings for our results from the simulations. The\nimportant point we want to emphasize is that our results imply a different and\nmuch stronger evolution of the black hole mass and accretion rate densities at\nhigh redshift relative to the stellar density and star formation rate density.\nThe black hole mass density tends to be assembled later than the stellar mass,\ndespite the growth of (a small number of) very massive BHs already at high\nredshift. However, for $z \\sim 3$ and below, our models predict that the black\nhole mass and stellar mass densities, as well as the BHAR and SFR densities,\nclosely track each other allowing only for small amounts of relative evolution\nbetween the two. \n\nAnother important point from Figure~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den} is that the feedback\nwe associate with black hole accretion does not significantly affect the\nglobal assembly of stellar mass. The peak of the SFR density is unaffected by\nthe inclusion of BH feedback, but the drop in SFR density ($z < 3$) is\nslightly more abrupt in the simulations with black holes. This effect becomes\nmore pronounced at $z\\sim 1$, the final redshift for our simulation.  At still\nlower redshift, we expect that BH feedback will become important in regulating\nthe cooling and star formation in very massive halos. This is then ascribed\nnot to quasar growth but rather to a `radio mode'. We explore this different\nfeedback channel in a companion paper by \\citet{Sijacki2007}.\n\n\\section{The $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{*}$ relations}\n\\label{msigmarel}\n\n\\subsection{Identification of groups and subgroups}\nAs a prerequisite for being able to study correlations between black\nhole and host galaxy properties in our simulation we first need to\napply a suitable group finding algorithm that reliably identifies the\nstellar mass associated with the different galaxies. Note that\nespecially the more massive halos identified by our basic\nfriends-of-friends grouping algorithm used for finding virialized\nobjects often contain a number of galaxies. This is illustrated in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:subgroups}, where we show a large cluster-sized group\nselected from the $z=1$ output of the {\\it BHCosmo} simulation. The\npanel on the left shows the gas density distribution in this large\ngroup, while the panel on the right hand side displays the stellar\ndistribution. It is evident that the group contains several,\ngravitationally bound galaxies.\n\nOur sub-group finder identifies all the galaxies within each group.  Our\nmethod to identify galaxies within a given group is based on a variant of the\n{\\small SUBFIND} algorithm \\citep{Springel2001}.  We first compute an\nadaptively smoothed baryonic density field for all stars and gas particles,\nallowing us to robustly identify centers of individual galaxies.  We find the\nextent of these galaxies by processing the gas and star particles in the order\nof declining density, adding particles one by one to the galaxies attached to\nthe galaxy to which its nearest denser neighbor already belongs~\\citep[see\nalso][]{Nagamine2004}. Note we are interested in the stellar and gas content\nof galaxies and associating the gaseous component to galaxies, as they\ntypically they contain very dense star-forming gas, makes the method very\nrobust in finding galaxies. This allows us to compute physical properties\nsuch as stellar mass, star formation rate, stellar velocity dispersion,\nmetallicity, black hole mass and BH accretion rate separately for each\ngalaxy. As an illustration, Figure~\\ref{fig:subgroups} shows the stellar\ndistribution associated with the largest galaxy in the group (which also hosts\nthe most massive BH in the group) in yellow.\n\nFor each galaxy/subgroup that contains stars and a black hole, we calculate the\nprojected (spherically averaged) half-mass effective radius, $R_e$, and the\nmass-weighted stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ within $R_e$.  Note however\nthat in order to make the measurements of $\\sigma$ and $R_e$ somewhat accurate\nwe only consider those objects that contain more than 100 stars particles\nwithin $R_e$.  This determination of $\\sigma$ closely resembles the procedure\nfor measuring the velocity dispersion from observational data\n\\citep{Gebhardt2000}, allowing for a direct comparison.\n\n\\subsection{The predicted $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\n  relationships and their evolution} Figures~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} and\n\\ref{fig:mbhmstar} plot the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelations, respectively, for our simulated galaxies at redshifts $z=1$, $2$,\n$3$, $4$, $5$ and $6.5$ (from top left to bottom right). Each measurement is\ncolor-coded according to the accretion rate of the corresponding black\nhole. We find a strong power-law correlation between both the velocity\ndispersion and the stellar mass with the black hole mass. Furthermore, at\n$z=1$, these correlations agree very well with the ones observed at the\npresent epoch~\\citep{Ferrarese2000, Gebhardt2000, Tremaine2002, Haring2004} \nover a large dynamic range. This is a remarkable confirmation of the basic\nmerger-driven scenario for self-regulated BH growth that we previously\nexplored in isolated high-resolution galaxy merger simulations. Based on the\nsame model, and without any fine-tuning or change of the model parameters, we\nhere obtain a good match to the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation\ndirectly from simulations that start from cosmological initial conditions and\nself-consistently account for the hierarchical build up galaxies in a\n$\\Lambda$CDM universe.\n\n\\subsubsection{The evolution of $M_{\\rm BH} -\\sigma$}\nAt higher redshifts, and in particular for $z > 3$, our results for the\n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation shows some degree of evolution relative to the\nlocal relations. To compare with the local  data as a function of time,\n we\nfit the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation at each redshift \nwith a simple power-law of the form \\beq \\log \\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm\n      BH}}{\\Msun}\\right) = a\\, \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{200 \\kmps}\\right) + b.\n\\label{eqn:msigmafit}\n\\eeq The best-fit relations thus obtained are shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} as solid black lines, with the dispersion indicated\nby hatched regions. The dotted lines are the best-fit relations for all\nredshifts combined. We compare with the observed relation as determined by\nT02, which is described by a slope $a=4.02$, a normalization $b=8.2$ and a\ndispersion $\\Delta \\sim 0.25-0.30$ (grey thick line in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma}).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Parameters of best-fit $M_{\\rm BH} -\\sigma$ relations}\n\\label{tab:msigma}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\\\\\nz  &  slope (a) & normalization, (b) & scatter $\\Delta$ & slope (a$_{s}$)\\\\\n \\hline\\\\\n1 ....... &  $3.95\\pm 0.10$ & $8.29\\pm0.03$ & 0.10 & 3.9  \\\\\n2 ....... &  $4.01\\pm 0.15$ & $8.42\\pm0.04$ & 0.16 & 4.1  \\\\\n3 ....... &  $4.21\\pm 0.22$ & $8.32\\pm0.07$ & 0.23 & 5.2 \\\\\n4 ....... &  $4.54\\pm 0.35$ & $8.17\\pm0.10$ & 0.36 & 6.7 \\\\\n5 ....... &  $3.37\\pm 0.45$ & $7.70\\pm0.13$ & 0.47 &  --   \\\\\n6.5 ..... &  $3.26\\pm 0.85$ & $7.50\\pm0.25$ & 0.89 &  --  \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe constants $a$ and $b$ for our best-fit relations and their dispersions are\ntabulated in Table~\\ref{tab:msigma} for different redshifts.  Note that we\nhere do not attempt to assess the statistical significance of the correlations\nin detail as the sources of systematic errors in the numerical measurements of\n$\\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$ cannot be easily quantified in the simulations.  In\nparticular, the cosmological simulations cannot determine the morphological\nproperties of galaxies and therefore do not provide a direct measure\nof spheroid masses or their velocity dispersions.  Our\nfitting procedure is merely intended to provide a first characterization of\nthe overall evolution of the slope and normalization of the relations in the\nsimulation model.  As Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} and Table~\\ref{tab:msigma}\nindicate, the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation predicted from our simulation is\nconsistent with a slope $\\sim 4$ at low redshift, as observed. At $z=3-4$, the\nslope appears to be slightly steeper and at $z=5-6$ slightly shallower, but the\nsmall number of systems at $z \\sim 6$ makes the latter trend uncertain.\n\nInspection of Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma} shows a qualitative trend whereby the\nlarger systems with high $\\sigma \\simgt 150 \\kmps$ (which are also those that\nare best resolved in our simulation) appear to populate the high mass end of\nthe $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation already at $z > 2-3$.  The lower mass end of\nthe $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation is then increasingly filled in towards $z\\sim\n1$. To illustrate this trend more explicitly, we perform a fit of the relation\nusing only those systems with $\\sigma \\ge 150\\kmps$; this is shown by the\ndashed line in Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhsigma}. The slope $a_{s}$ obtained for these\n`high' $\\sigma$ black holes is typically steeper than for the full relation\n(our measured values for $a_{s}$ are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:msigma}). At a\nfixed and relatively high $\\sigma$, the mean $M_{\\rm BH}$ is larger at $z\\sim\n3-4$ than at $z\\sim 1$.  This trend suggests that black hole growth predates\nthe final growth of the spheroid potential at scales $\\sigma \\sim 170\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the recent measurements of the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ relation in a sample of Seyferts at $z\\sim 0.35$ by\n\\citet{Woo2006}. This relatively more efficient black hole growth at a fixed\n$\\sigma$ at high redshift may thus be responsible for a mild change in the\nhigh mass end of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation. In the remainder of this\nsection we will discuss possible additional dependences in the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ \\citep{Hopkins2007a} relation which may produces a small change in\nthe slope of the relation with time.\n\nNote also that at $z \\ge 4$ black holes are more likely to accrete close to\ntheir critical Eddington rates, as we showed earlier. In our models, the\n$M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation is a natural consequence of the self-regulated\ngrowth of black holes \\citep{DiMatteo2005}, where a black hole grows until its\nreleased energy is sufficient to expel the gas in its surroundings in a quasar\ndriven wind, which then terminates nuclear accretion. For this reason, we\nexpect the relation to show more scatter at times when most systems are still\nactively growing and accreting close to their Eddington values (see\nTable~\\ref{tab:msigma}). This is expected as the primary path for assembly BH\nmass is via accretion during major mergers so that the relations converge and\nget increasingly tighter as galaxies undergo major mergers and continue to\nmerge.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace*{-0.4cm}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f10.ps}}\n\\caption{The stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ versus stellar\n$M_{*}$ at $z=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6.5$ (indicated by different\ncolors from blue to pink, the same ones as used in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:D6acc_den}-\\ref{fig:bhaf}).

Below $z \\sim 3$, there is virtually no evolution (bearing in\nmind the weak trend discussed above for $\\sigma > 150 \\kmps$), while\nwe find a weak drift of the normalization beyond $z\\sim 3$.  A rough\nparameterization of this evolution in the normalization of the $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma$ relation is given by $ M_{\\rm BH}/\\sigma^4 \\propto\n(1+z)^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha =-0.2$.\n\nThese results for an overall modest evolution in the normalization are in\nqualitative agreement with those from an analysis of isolated galaxy merger\nsimulations by \\citet{Robertson2006a}.  We note that in the latter study a\nredshift scaling of galaxy properties and a specific set of structural\nproperties of the merging galaxies had to be assumed, which introduced an\nimportant systematic uncertainty. While having lower numerical resolution per\nmerger, the simulation we analyze here eliminates this caveat by providing a\nfully self-consistent cosmological history for the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies and their black holes (albeit at a lower spatial resolution). This\nprovides an important confirmation of the analysis of \\citet{Robertson2006a},\nwho however did not find evidence for an evolution of the slope at the high\nmass end of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation.\n\n%Note that, as shown in the isolated merger studies, the normalization of the\n%$M_{BH}-\\sigma$ relationship is also set by adjusting the feedback\n%parameter, $\\epsilon_{\\rm f}$. As we have kept this fixed at $5\\%$ consistent\n%with these latter studies, the slope of the relations is not adjustable or\n%tunable but a natural consequence of the self-regulated black hole growth.\n\n%here\n\n\\subsubsection{The evolution of $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:mbhmstar}, we show the $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relation\nfrom the simulations at $z=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ and $6.5$, alongside\nthe local observational relation determined by \\citet[][thick grey\nlines]{Haring2004}. Our best-fit relation at each redshift is shown by\na solid line while the dotted lines in each panel show results for the\nother redshifts. Table~\\ref{tab:mbhmstar} gives the slope $c$,\nnormalization $d$, and dispersion $\\Delta_m$ for our best-fit\nrelations of the form\n\\beq \\log \\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm BH}}{\\Msun}\\right) = c \\log\n\\left(\\frac{M_{*}}{10^{11} \\Msun}\\right) + d.\n\\label{eqn:mbhmstarfit}\n\\eeq As before, our fitted values for $c$ and $d$ are intended to\nindicate general trends in the evolution rather than to be used as\nstatistically rigorous measurements.  The observed relationship\n\\citep{Haring2004} has a slope $c=1.12$ and normalization $d=8.2$.\n\nOverall there appears to be only limited evolution in the $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelation, but there is a slight steepening at $z=2-4$.  To highlight this\ntrend, we restrict our fits to the high mass end with $M_{*}\\ge 5\\times\n10^{10}\\Msun$ (dashed line in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mbhmstar}). In this range, the\nrelation is significantly steeper, implying slopes $c_s \\sim 1.9$ at $z=3-4$\nand $\\sim 1.5$ at $z\\sim 2$.  This is more significant than the evolution\nfound in the slope of $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$, and implies that there is some\nevolution in the ratio of black hole mass to stellar mass relative to the\nlocal observations. More precisely, systems with $M_{*} \\simgt 10^{10} \\Msun$\nhave larger black hole masses at fixed $M_{*}$ than at $z=1$, where the ratio\nis in good agreement with the relation observed at the present epoch.  This\ntrend of an increasing $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}$ ratio as a function of redshift\nappears consistent with the recent measurements of high redshift (up to $z\n\\sim 3.5$) BH masses and host luminosities by \\citet{Peng2006},\nas well as the BHFP \\citep{Hopkins2007a}. We will\nfurther analyze this effect in \\S~\\ref{sec:fgas}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Parameters of best-fit $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$ relations}\n\\label{tab:mbhmstar}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\\\\\n$z$  &  slope $c$ & normalization $d$ & scatter $\\Delta$ & c$_{s}$\\\\\n \\hline\\\\\n1 ....... &  $1.18\\pm0.02$ & $8.10\\pm0.03$ & 0.03 &1.2 \\\\\n2 ....... &  $1.23\\pm0.03$ & $8.09\\pm0.03$ & 0.04 & 1.5 \\\\\n3 ....... &  $1.25\\pm 0.04$ & $8.04\\pm0.04$ & 0.06 & 1.9 \\\\\n4 ....... &  $1.30\\pm 0.05$ & $8.04\\pm0.05$ & 0.07 &1.9 \\\\\n5 ....... &  $1.17\\pm 0.10$ & $7.90\\pm0.10$ & 0.14 & 2.0 \\\\\n6.5 ..... &  $1.01\\pm 0.22$ & $7.78\\pm0.25$ & 0.34 & -- \\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Evolution of $\\sigma$, gas fraction, and $R_e$,\n at fixed stellar host mass}\n\\label{sec:fgas}\nWe now analyze some of the physical properties of the host galaxies\nand their evolution with redshift to investigate the physical origin\nfor the trends we have found in the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm\nBH} -M_{*}$ relations.  Figure~\\ref{fig:sigma_mstar} shows the stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$ versus the stellar mass $M_{*}$ for each\ngalaxy as a function of redshift. The dotted lines and the solid line\n(for $z=1$) show our best-fit relations. At a fixed $M_{*}$, the\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$ increases with increasing redshift. This\nis consistent with the results from the merger remnants in\n\\citet{Robertson2006a} and reflects changes in the structural\nproperties of stellar spheroids, which become smaller towards higher\nredshift.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:fgasre}, we show the projected half mass radius $R_e$, the\ncold gas fraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ (a proxy for the disk gas fraction), and the\n$\\left<M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}\\right>$ ratio as a function of redshift. We show\nresults for systems with $M_{*} \\ge 3 \\times 10^{10} \\Msun$ (dashed lines) and\n$M_{*} \\ge 6 \\times 10^{10} \\Msun$ (solid lines). We find higher cold gas\nfractions in higher redshift systems with $f_{gas} \\propto\n(1+z)^{1.5}$. The increased gas content, dissipation rate in high redshift\nprogenitor is consistent with them being more centrally concentrated, as\nshown by the trend of decreasing $R_{e}$ and increasing $\\sigma$ with\nincreasing redshift, leading to larger ratios $M_{\\rm BH} /M_{*}$ at high\nredshifts, with $M_{\\rm BH} /M_{*} \\sim (1+z)^{0.5}$, at least over these\nranges of $M_{*}$. Larger values of $\\sigma$ at fixed $M_{*}$ at high redshift\nare also consistent with an inverse overall trend (e.g.; $(1+z)^{-0.2}$) in\nthe evolution of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation.\n\nThe above results are consistent with the general picture for a merger-driven\nquasar growth we have developed based on our galaxy merger\nsimulations~\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a, Robertson2006a, Hopkins2005,\nHopkins2006a, Hopkins2007a} , which also implies that the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$\nand $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations are connected to each other. This connection\nis most clearly demonstrated by the `black hole fundamental plane' (BHFP)\nrelation discussed by \\citet{Hopkins2007a}, which arises from the joint\nformation process of spheroids and massive black holes in mergers. Our\ncosmological simulations also should agree with the BHFP if most of the BH\ngrowth is associated with mergers.  In Figure~\\ref{fig:fplane}, we show our\nsimulation measurements for the BHFP and compare it to the the best-fit from\n\\citet{Hopkins2007a}, shown as a solid line.  We find very good agreement with\nthe predictions for the BHFP by \\citet{Hopkins2007a}, in both of its\nformulations, i.e.~for $R_e$ and $\\sigma$ or $M_{*}$ and $\\sigma$, although\nthe former shows a larger scatter than the latter, owing to the noisy\nmeasurements of $R_e$ in the cosmological simulation.\n\n\n\\section{The first and the most massive black holes}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{17.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f13.ps}}\\vspace*{-1.8cm}\n\\end{center}\n \\caption{Individual mass assembly and accretion rate histories for\nthe six most massive black holes and two intermediate mass BHs (chosen\nrandomly) in the {\\it BHCosmo} run. The top panel shows the black hole\nmass as a function of redshift while the bottom four panels give the\ndetailed accretion rate history for the black holes with the\ncorresponding colors in the top panel. The first supermassive black\nhole forming in the {\\it BHCosmo} run, and the most massive one at the\nend of the run, are shown with thicker lines in pink and blue,\nrespectively. From the bottom panels we see that phases of high\nEddington accretion occur at different times of the history of\ndifferent black holes.\n\\label{fig:accrhistD6}}\n\\end{figure*}\nIn the previous sections we have discussed the predictions from our\nsimulation for the global history of black hole mass assembly in\ngalaxies from the high redshift Universe to today. We have compared\nthe predictions for the evolution of the black hole mass and accretion\nrate density to the history of the star formation rate density and\ndiscussed the growth of the black hole mass function.  We have also\ndiscussed the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH} -M_{*}$\nrelationships as a function of time, and examined which physical\nproperties drive their cosmological evolution.\n\nHowever, our simulation methodology not only allows us to make statistical\nstatements about the black hole population. Rather, it can also be used to\nstudy the detailed growth history of individual black holes, from the moment\nthey are seeded to today, which provides a particularly powerful way to follow\nthe evolution of black holes over cosmic time. The gas which fuels black hole\nactivity ultimately has its origins in the intergalactic medium, draining\nalong filaments into forming galaxies. Because of this, BH radiative histories\nare directly linked to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe,\nfrom supercluster scales down to the immediate environment of host galaxies.\nBeing able to follow these large-scale processes and their impact on\nindividual black holes self-consistently is the key to a qualitatively better\nlevel of understanding. For example, we have the tools to examine what turns a\nsmall black hole into a supermassive one at $z=6$, or whether some BHs grow\nhardly at all after this initial phase (as we shall see below in some\nexamples). We can ask how quasar lifetimes are related to their clustering,\nhow important BH mergers versus gas accretion are in the cosmological growth\nof BH mass, what BH light curves look like in detail over a Hubble time,\nand how specific outbursts correlate with galaxy and cluster merger and\naccretion events.\n\nIn future work we will return to address such questions in more detail; for\nexample in \\citet{Colberg07} we present an extensive study of BH environments\nas the universe evolves.  For now we will show that there are some striking\ninferences to be drawn from following the detailed histories of even a few\nblack holes.  As an example we choose to focus on the formation and fate of\nthe first large black holes that form in our simulation, as well as the\nproperties of their hosts and their descendants. This allows us to identify\nthe prerequisite conditions for the growth of supermassive black holes already\nin the early universe.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{17.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=270]{f14.ps}}\n\\end{center}\n \\caption{Time evolution of the environment around the host galaxy of\nthe first supermassive massive black hole at $z=6$ (bottom panels),\nand of the most massive BH at $z=1$ (top panels) in the {\\it BHcosmo}\nrun. The location and masses of the supermassive BHs are marked by\narrows of different size, as labeled. While the bottom system hosts\nthe most massive black hole at high redshift, it does not end up\nhosting also the most massive black hole at the center of the largest\ngalaxy at low redshift. Instead, the system shown in the top panels\novertakes it in growth at intermediate redshifts, when it is formed in\nthe highest density region in the simulation, which is a protocluster\nregion.\n    \\label{fig:2bigbhs}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nObservations of luminous SDSS quasars at redshifts as high as $z \\sim\n6$ \\citep{Fan2003} present a number of challenges for models of high\nredshift quasar and galaxy formation. Their low space density suggests\nthat they reside in the rarest dark matter density peaks at this early\nepoch, yet the apparent lack of companion galaxies in the field has\nbeen used to argue that these quasars reside in far more common halos\n\\citep{Carilli2004, Willott2005}. Extensive follow-up observations of\nthe highest redshift ($z=6.42$) quasar, SDSS J11148+5251, are starting\nto constrain the properties of its host galaxy \\citep{Walter2004}.  CO\nobservations indicate a relatively small stellar spheroid, however,\nthe existence of CO, iron and carbon emission indicates a heavily\nenriched ISM and vigorous star formation \\citep{Maiolino2005}. In any\ncase, rapid growth is clearly required to produce large supermassive\nblack holes and spheroids in the $\\sim 800$ million years available to\n$z\\sim 6$.  Unsurprisingly, the type of object associated with the\n'first quasar' is therefore still a matter of debate.\n\n%Because of the rarity - models assume 10^13 mass halos - millenium run\n%pick the halo here we do not pick --- this is the major difference...\n% WRITE SOME OF THIS STUFF>>..\n\nThe relatively small volume of our simulation prevents us from directly\naddressing the problem of the `first quasars', simply because their space\ndensity is so low. Properly identifying one of the rare host systems requires\nat the very least box-sizes of $500\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$\n\\citep{SpringelMillennium2005}, or more adequately $1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}$\n\\citep{Li2007}.  Nevertheless, our simulation allows us to examine the nature\nof the environments and the hosts where exponential growth of BHs can first\noccur at early times. This has some relevance to the problem of where the\nfirst quasars are likely to form.\n\nIn order to retrieve the required information for all the black holes in the\nsimulation we have constructed full merger trees for each of them. This allows\nus to track the growth and accretion history of individual black holes of\ndifferent masses, make detailed lightcurves from their accretion histories,\nand study the properties of their host galaxies.\n\n\n\\subsection{Individual BH mass and accretion rate as function of $z$}\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6}, we show the accretion histories of a\nnumber of black holes in the {\\it BHCosmo} run (top panel) and some\nexamples of their corresponding accretion rate histories in the bottom\nfour panels. The sample in the top panel consists of the six most\nmassive black holes in the simulation and two randomly chosen ones\nwith an intermediate mass at $z=1$. The four bottom panels show the\naccretion rate in units of Eddington for four black holes with\ncorresponding line colors, including the most massive black hole at\n$z=6$, the most massive and second most massive at $z=1$, and finally\none of the intermediate mass ones.  Note that this is a small\nsub-sample of the several thousand black holes in the simulation. We\nfocus here on the evolution of the most massive ones, and in\nparticular on their early formation and the fate of their descendants.\nIn \\citet{Colberg07}, we study a complete sample of individual BH\nhistories as a function of environments for the entire simulation.\n\nThe first interesting result shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6} is\nthat even in this small volume conditions exist that are conducive for\nexponential black hole growth, as required by the presence of quasars\nat $z\\sim 6$ with the large observed masses. The evolution of the mass\nof the largest black hole in our simulation at early times is shown by\nthe thick pink line.  The corresponding accretion rate history (in the\nsame color) shows a rapid succession of numerous phases of high\naccretion at the critical Eddington rate, between $ 5 \\simlt z \\simlt\n7.5$. Below $z\\sim5$, the black hole is drastically more quiescent,\nexcept for a couple of sporadic Eddington phases at around $z\\sim 2$.\nInterestingly, this first most massive black hole at $z \\sim 6$ is not\nthe most massive one at $z=1$. Instead, it is `overtaken' in growth by\nanother black hole shown with the blue thick line, which is the most\nmassive black hole at the end of the simulation.  The Eddington growth\nphases for this objects start at $z < 6$ and extend all to way to\n$z\\sim 3.5$. By $z \\sim 4.5$, the black hole mass in this system\ncatches up with that of the first massive black hole, and then keeps\ngrowing exponentially to $z\\sim4$.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:2bigbhs}, we show projected gas density maps of the\nhost galaxies and the surrounding structures (at redshifts $z=7.5$,\n$4$, and $1.6$) for two of these black holes, the one that is most\nmassive at $z=1$, and the one that is most massive at $z=6$.  This\nprovides good clues for the origin of the evolutionary difference\nbetween these two systems. Although the hosts of both black holes at\n$z=7.5$ are halos of similar mass, $\\sim 10^{10} \\Msun$, one of them\nlies at the intersection of three small filaments, leading to\nefficient gas cooling and a high star formation of $\\sim 100\n\\Msun$yr$^{-1}$. The host galaxy grows rapidly until $z=6$ but then\nits gas supply dwindles, and at $z\\sim4$ it is overtaken by the other\nblack hole.  This latter one lies on a very massive filament, which\ngrows even more vigorously at this later time than its host galaxy\n(which has a SFR of $\\sim 1000 \\Msun$yr$^{-1}$ at $z\\sim 2$). In this\nway a large stellar spheroid is produced around the BH, which\neventually will end up at the center of a rich cluster of galaxies.\nOur results therefore show that a massive black hole that is found in\nthe cD of large galaxy cluster at late times was not necessarily the\nmost massive one at $z=6$, as it has been often assumed in the\nliterature \\citep[e.g.][]{SpringelMillennium2005}. Since the growth\nhistory of black holes is intertwined with the non-linear processes of\nstructure formation, individual growth histories of BHs can be complex\nand need not preserve the rank order in a group of BHs that start out\nwith similar masses.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-0.5cm}\n\\resizebox{8.5cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f15.ps}}\n \\caption{Comparison of individual black hole mass histories in the\n{\\it BHCosmo} run (blue lines, D6) and in the larger simulation volume\nof the E6 run (red lines).

The 'catch-up' of larger black holes that form later and in higher\ndensity regions (see text) can also be seen, and is comparable to the\ncase shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6}.\n    \\label{fig:accrhistD6E6}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{17.0cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{f16.ps}}%\n\\vspace*{-0.8cm}\n\\end{center}\n \\caption{Black hole merger history trees shown as a function of\nredshift ($y$-axis) and position (along the $x$-axis), for the most\nmassive black hole at $z=1$ in the {\\it BHCosmo} run.

In this larger volume, there are a\nhandful of more examples of early exponential black hole growth\nbetween $8\\simlt z \\simlt 6$, as shown by the red black hole mass\ngrowth curves in Figure~\\ref{fig:accrhistD6E6}.  Consistent with our\nprevious finding, there are again black holes that 'catch-up' in\ngrowth to the most massive black hole at some earlier time. We note\nthat we have run this larger volume simulation with the specific\npurpose of checking the {\\it BHCosmo} results for the first\nsupermassive black holes by obtaining better statistics for large\nhalos at $z\\simgt 6$. For this reason, this simulations was not\nevolved beyond $z=4$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{BH merger trees for the first and the most massive black hole}\nFigures~\\ref{fig:tree1} and \\ref{fig:tree6} show two example black\nhole merger trees, one for the most massive black hole at $z=1$, and\none for the $z=1$ descendant of the first supermassive black hole at $z\n\\sim 6$. All progenitor black holes that merge together to build up\nthe final BH are included in the trees.  The black hole masses along\nthe tree are represented by different sizes of the circles, while the\ncolor encodes their accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate.  In\nboth figures, the top-left panel shows the full BH merger tree,\nwhereas the top-right and bottom two panels split the tree according\nto accretion rate of the BHs.\n\nInspection of these two BH trees immediately reveals a complex and\nrich merger history for the most massive black holes at $z=1$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:tree1}), as opposed to the comparatively isolated\nevolution of the most massive object at $z=6$, which only features\nthree major branches for its tree (Fig.~\\ref{fig:tree6}). The large\nmajority of the mass in the latter case is built up by early phases of\ncritical gas accretion at $z \\simlt 6$. On the other hand, in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:tree1}, Eddington accretion phases are spread out\nalong many branches of the tree and cover a much larger range of\nredshifts.  At redshifts $z < 3$, the progenitors are preferentially\naccreting at low Eddington rates, so that the residual growth of the final\nblack hole mass increasingly occurs from ``dry'' mergers with other\nblack holes, consistent with our earlier results for the global black\nhole growth.\n\n\n\\section{Summary and discussion\\label{sec:conclusions}}\nIn this paper we have investigated the coupled formation and evolution\nof black holes and galaxies using state-of-the-art cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. For the first\ntime, we have incorporated black hole growth and associated feedback\nfrom quasar activity self-consistently in cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our approach has been based on the methodology recently\ndeveloped and tested in simulations of galaxy mergers\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a}. In this initial paper we have\nfocused on investigating the model predictions for (i) the global\nhistory of black hole mass assembly and its relation to the history of\nstar formation, from high redshift to the present, for (ii) the\nevolution of the BH mass function and accretion rate function and its\nconnection to the observational ``downsizing'' phenomenon, for (iii)\nthe correlations between black hole mass, velocity dispersion, and\nstellar mass of host galaxies, and finally, for (iv) the formation and\nfate of the first quasars and the properties of their hosts.\n\nAn important and highly encouraging first result has has been that the\ncosmological black hole mass density $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ predicted by our\nhigh-resolution simulation reproduces the locally measured value and\nits extrapolation to higher redshift ($z< 2.5$), inferred from\nintegrating the X-ray luminosity functions \\citep{YuTremaine2002, Marconi2004,\nShankar2004}, or, more directly, the bolometric quasar\nluminosity function \\citep{Hopkins2007b}.\nWe predict a steep evolution of $\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ as a\nfunction of redshift, with a rise that is more rapid than that of the\nstar formation rate. At $z > 3$, $\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*} \\propto\n(1+z)^{-3}$ whereas there is at most weak evolution in the ratio\n$\\rho_{\\rm BH}/\\rho_{*}$ at $z \\lesssim 3$. Similarly, whilst the star\nformation rate density $\\dot\\rho_{*}$ broadly tracks the BHAR density\n$\\dot\\rho_{\\rm BH}$ below $z\\sim 2.5-3$, their ratio evolves steeply\nat higher redshifts, as $\\dot\\rho_{\\rm BH}/ \\dot\\rho_{*} \\propto\n(1+z)^{-4}$.  The SFR density peaks earlier than the BHAR density and\nexhibits a more gradual evolution with redshift compared to the BHAR.\nOnly at redshifts below the peak of the BHAR, the BHAR and SFR rate\ndensities start tracking each other.\n\nOur results for the evolution of the BHAR density are broadly\nconsistent with constraints obtained by \\citet{Hopkins2007b} from a\ncomprehensive analysis of a large sample of observational data sets,\nwhich allowed them to synthesize the evolution of the bolometric\nquasar luminosity density with redshift and to show that the\nluminosity density indeed peaks at $z\\sim 2-3$, with a sharp drop\ntowards higher redshifts.\n\n\nWe have shown that the growth of the black hole mass function shows\nsigns of `anti-hierarchical' behavior, or `downsizing'.  The high mass\nend of the BH mass function is established at comparatively high\nredshift and then significantly slows down in evolution below $z \\sim\n2$, where only the abundance of intermediate mass BHs is still growing\nappreciably.  We have found more direct evidence for black hole\n``downsizing'' by inspecting the distribution of accretion rates, in\nunis of the critical Eddington rate. The accretion rate function\nshifts from a narrow distribution dominated by high Eddington rates at\nhigh redshift to a broad distribution with a small fraction of\nEddington accretion for low redshifts ($z < 3$). High mass black holes,\nforming in the high density peaks at high redshift are built up\nrapidly by vigorous accretion. However, the effects of gas depletion\nand AGN feedback drive a strong decline in the accretion rate of\nmassive black holes towards late times, while during these later times\nthe peak of the accretion activity shifts to progressively smaller\nmass scales.\n\n%Gas depletion in large halos and suppression of further cooling by feedback\n%processes are likely to play a role in these trends.\n\nThe BH masses of our simulated galaxies are strongly correlated with the\nstellar velocity dispersions and stellar masses of their host galaxies, and\nthe correlations agree remarkably well with the local $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$\nand $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relationships, over a large dynamic range. We\npreviously showed with simulations of isolated galaxy mergers\n\\citep{DiMatteo2005, Robertson2006a, Hopkins2007a} that our AGN feedback\nprescription leads to a self-regulated BH growth that can explain the \n$M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation. \nIt is highly reassuring that the same simulation\nmodel, with an unmodified feedback efficiency $\\epsilon_f$ reproduces the\nobserved $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ in full cosmological simulations as well. We\nemphasize that the free parameter $\\epsilon_f$ sets the normalization of the\nobtained relationship, but the slope and scatter of the relation obtained from\nthe simulations are not adjustable and a non-trivial consequence of the\nself-regulated BH growth.\n\nOur simulation also suggests a weak evolution with redshift of the\nnormalization of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation, as $M_{\\rm BH}\n/\\sigma \\sim (1+z)^{-0.2}$. However, we find that this evolutionary\ntrend is sensitive to range of masses being probed. When we focus on\nthe better resolved more massive systems, there appears to be some\nmild evolution in the slope of the BH scaling relations at high\n$\\sigma$ and for high $M_{*}$. In particular, we find a trend of\nincreasing $M_{*}/ M_{\\rm BH}$ with redshift, in agreement with recent\ndirect estimates of the BH to host stellar mass ratio at high redshift\nby \\citet{Peng2006}. This trend is accompanied by an increase in the\ncold gas fraction in the host galaxy, and a smaller $R{_e}$ at a fixed\nstellar mass.  These results are consistent with the suggestion that\nthe $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ and $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations are\nprojections of a more basic correlation,\nthe black hole fundamental plane \\citep{Hopkins2007a}, \n$M_{\\rm BH} \\propto \\sigma^3\nR_{e}^{0.5}$, and the interpretation that gas-rich systems at high\nredshift produce more dissipative mergers that lead to more\nconcentrated BH hosts.\n\n\nOur findings for the BH scaling relations appear fully consistent with a\nscenario where quasar activity is driven by galaxy mergers, as suggested by\nour simulations of isolated mergers \\citep{DiMatteo2005, Springel2005a,\nRobertson2006a, Hopkins2006a, Hopkins2007a}. While gas is available for star\nformation over a large range of mass scales, it can only gets to central\nregions of galaxies in large amounts as a result of the inflows that accompany\nmajor mergers. At the same time, the mergers produce spheroids, which together\nwith the growth-limiting quasar feedback establishes the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$\nrelationship.  The detailed time evolution of the quasar activity in an\nindividual galaxy depends on the angular momentum of the gas and the disk size\nand morphology. It is clear that the limited spatial resolution of our\ncosmological simulation is a severe limitation on how faithfully this can be\ntracked in our calculation, but because the final BH masses in merger remnants\nare robustly predicted by our simulation methodology even at coarse resolution\nthis does not seriously affect the quantities we study here.\n\nOur simulated volumes are too small to directly check if a population\nof supermassive black holes as massive the $z\\sim 6$ Sloan quasars can\nform at high redshift. However, we do find that our simulation model\nproduces black holes at early times that spend a large fraction of\ntheir time at high accretion rates close to their Eddington rates. We\ntherefore predict the presence of massive black holes at high\nredshift. Using high-resolution simulations of multiple mergers that\nwere constructed to represent a high redshift merging tree of one of\nthe most massive protocluster regions in a $(1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$\nvolume, \\citet{Li2007} have recently made the match with the Sloan\nquasar much more explicit. They were able to show that the gas-rich\nmergers expected in this rare overdensity can indeed grow a BH of mass\n$\\sim 10^{9}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ early enough.\n\nWe have also found that the first supermassive black hole in our simulation\nforms in relative isolation, as a result of strong gas inflows and merging at\nthe intersection of large-scale filaments. However, by following this system\nto lower redshift it turned out that it did not evolve into the most massive\nblack hole today. Instead, it was overtaken in growth by a black hole that\nacquired most of its mass in major mergers in a high density region at lower\nredshift. Such a change in the relative rank of BHs as a function of time\nappears quite generic, as we explicitly checked with a simulation of larger\nvolume. This clearly complicates attempts to directly link high redshift\nprogenitor systems to low redshift descendants. As we have demonstrated, the\ncosmological simulation methodology we introduced here provides however an\nexcellent tool for studying the evolution of the cosmic BH evolution. In the\npresent study, we focused only on the radiatively efficient accretion mode of\nAGN, which is associated with quasar activity. For following AGN activity also\nin clusters of galaxies, and hence down to $z=0$ in large volumes, we also\nneed to account radio activity, which becomes important in very massive halos\nat low redshift. In \\citet{Sijacki2007} we present an extension of our\nsimulation methodology that accounts for this physics, and we discuss results\nobtained with this unified model for AGN feedback both for clusters of\ngalaxies and cosmological boxes.\n \nOur cosmological approach to black hole formation enables us to follow the\nfuel for black hole activity from its ultimate source, the early intergalactic\nmedium, and so link the large-scale structure and environments of black holes\ndirectly with their growth. As a result, countless different avenues of\nresearch are opened up and we plan to explore many in future work. For\nexample, in \\citet{Colberg07} we use merger trees constructed for every black\nhole in the simulation to carry out a systematic study of their environments\nand histories and to determine the amount of black hole growth owing to\nmergers versus gas accretion; the latter should be testable with upcoming\ngravitational wave experiments. Future issues which will be addressed include\nthe nature of AGN clustering and its evolution and its relation to the\nunderlying dark matter clustering, predictions for quasar lifetimes and\nluminosity functions, and how feedback from AGN may manifest itself on\nlarge-scales and can be detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. With\nour new approach we can address the question of how the first black hole\nformed and grew we will be able to make predictions for the ionizing\nbackground owing to the first miniquasars, an important but currently uncertain\ningredient in current models of reionization.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe thank Rupert Croft for many discussions and reading the manuscript.\nThe simulations were performed at Carnegie Mellon University and the\nPittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC). \nThis work has been supported in part through NSF AST-0607819.\n\n%We thank Karen Tozzi, for design...\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apj}\n\\bibliography{ms}\n\n\n\\end{document}\n\n\n"}

In fact, the prediction of BBN changes\nsignificantly if there exists an exotic massive particle with long\nlifetime.  (Hereafter, we call such a particle $X$.)  When the lifetime\nof $X$ is longer than about 1 sec, the decay of $X$ may induce\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers, which lead to photo- and\nhadro-dissociation of ${\\rm ^4He}$ and subsequent non-thermal production\nof other light elements (${\\rm D}$, ${\\rm ^3He}$, ${\\rm ^6Li}$, and\n${\\rm ^7Li}$).  Such processes may significantly change the prediction\nof the standard BBN scenario and, consequently, resultant abundances of\nlight elements may conflict with observations.  Furthermore, the\nelectromagnetic energy injection causes distortion of the CMB spectrum.\nSince the observation~\\cite{FIRAS} shows that this distortion is quite\nsmall, we can constrain the abundance of $X$.  Finally, if the lifetime\nis very long, the spectrum of neutrinos and photons produced by the\ndecay of $X$ are not thermalized and may be directly observed.\n\nThe effects of the long-lived particles on BBN were well studied for\nradiative decay~\\cite{BBNwX_OLD, KMrad,Holtmann:1998gd,Rad_recent} and\nfor hadronic decay~\\cite{Dominguez:1987,\nReno:1987qw,HadronicDecay,Kohri:2001jx,KKM04,Kohri:2005wn,Jedamzik:2006xz}\nand stringent constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X$ were\nobtained. However, when $X$ mainly decays into neutrinos, it is expected\nthat the constraints become much weaker because of weakness of\ninteractions between neutrinos and other standard model particles.  The\nspecific case where a sneutrino mainly decays into a gravitino and a\nneutrino has been already discussed in\n\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs,FenSuTak,Kanzaki:2006hm}.  Such a scenario is\nrealized when the sneutrino is the next lightest superparticle (NLSP)\nwhile the gravitino is the lightest superparticle (LSP).\\footnote\n%%\n{For the case that the gravitino is the the NLSP and that sneutrino is\n  the LSP, see also \\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}.}\n%%\nIn such a case, interaction of $X$ (i.e., sneutrino) is well-known,\nand it is found that BBN provides the most stringent constraint.\n\nHowever, there are other possibilities of having long-lived massive\nparticles which dominantly decay into  neutrinos.  For example, if the\nLSP is axino ($\\tilde{a}$) and the NLSP is sneutrino, dominant \ndecay process of the\nsneutrino ($=X$) is $\\tilde{\\nu}\\to\\nu+\\tilde{a}$.  \nDecay rate of this process\ndepends on the properties of axion supermultiplet.  Thus, in general,\nproperties of $X$ (i.e., lifetime, hadronic branching ratio, and so\non) is model-dependent.  Consequently, the most stringent bound may not\nbe from BBN.  For example, high energy neutrinos emitted in the $X$\nparticle decay was considered in \\cite{Gondolo:1991rn} where the upper\nbounds on the $X$ abundance were obtained from nucleon-decay detectors\nand Fly's Eye air shower array.\n%Neutrino emission from gravitinos at BBN epoch was studied in\n%Ref.~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs} and it was shown that electrons and\n%positrons produced via scattering off background neutrinos induce\n%electromagnetic showers which significantly affect BBN.  Moreover, the\n%emitted high energy neutrinos scatter off the background leptons\n%($\\nu$, $e^{\\pm}$) and produce charged pions. Pions emitted at $\\sim\n%1$~sec increases $p$-$n$ ratio and hence increases $^4$He abundance.\n%However, this effect was not taken into account\n%in~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}\n\nIn this paper, we derive general cosmological constraints on scenarios\nin which there exists a long-lived massive particle which dominantly\ndecays into a neutrino (and something else).  We treat the lifetime and\nhadronic branching ratio of the long-lived particle as free\nparameters.  In this case, in fact, the constraint from the main decay\nmode is quite weak, and other subdominant decay channel which contain\nelectronic and hadronic particles may be\nimportant~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}.  In our analysis, we take into\naccount both of these decay channels and discuss various cosmological\nconstraints.\n%In fact, when the $X$ particles mainly decay into neutrinos, \n%it is also possible for $X$ to decay into $SU(2)$ partners, i.e., \n%charged leptons with some branching ratio $B_X$. \n%Since $B_X$ is very model-dependent, we set \n%$B_X=10^{-3}, 10^{-6}$ as the representative values \n%throughout this paper. \n\nOrganization of this paper is as followis.  In Section \\ref{sec:bbn},\nwe discuss BBN constraints.  In Section \\ref{sec:cmb}, constraints\nfrom CMB is considered.  Then in Section \\ref{sec:diffuse}, we study\nconstraints from diffuse neutrino and photon.  Section\n\\ref{sec:conclusion} is devoted for conclusion.\n\n\\section{BBN Constraints}\n\\label{sec:bbn}\n\nBefore going into the main subject of this section, which is the\nconstraints from the BBN, let us first summarize the properties of the\nlong-lived heavy particle $X$ which mainly decays into a neutrino (and\nsome other weakly interacting particle).  In our study, we assume that\n$X$ mainly decays as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n X \\rightarrow \\nu + Y,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $Y$ is an invisible particle which is very weakly interacting so\nthat it does not cause any subsequent scattering with background\nparticles.  One of the well-motivated examples is the case where the\nsneutrino is the NLSP while gravitino (or axino) is the LSP.  (Then,\n$X$ is the sneutrino and $Y$ is the gravitino or axino.)  In addition,\nfor concreteness, we assume that the final-state neutrino is electron\nneutrino.  (We note here that we have checked that the constraints on\nthe properties of $X$ are not sensitive to the flavor of the\nfinal-state neutrino.)\n\nEven though the dominant decay mode is the two-body process, one\nshould keep in mind that decay chennels with three- and/or four-body\nfinal state should also exist since the neutrino as well as $X$ and/or\n$Y$ couple to $Z$- and $W$-bosons.  The emitted (real or virtual) weak\nbosons subsequently decay into quarks and leptons.  With this type of\nthree- and/or four-body decay processes, energetic quarks and charged\nleptons are produced.\n\nIf the decays of $X$ occur during or after BBN, the standard-model\nparticles emitted in the decay can affect the abundances of primordial\nlight elements.  First the high energy neutrinos emitted in the main\ndecay mode (two-body decay) scatter off the background leptons and\nproduce charged leptons ($e^{\\pm}$, $\\mu^{\\pm}$) and charged\npions. The former induce electromagnetic showers which destroy light\nelements, and the latter change the $n$-$p$ ratio through nucleon and\npion interactions.  Second $X$ decays into electromagnetic and\nhadronic particles via the three- and/or four-body decay modes with\nsmall branching ratio $B_X$.  Such processes directly induce\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers and change the abundances of\nlight elements~\\cite{KKM04}.\n\n\\subsection{Two-body Decay}\n\nFirst, we discuss effects of the dominant decay process $X\\to Y+\\nu_e$.\nWe presume that $Y$ produced in the decay is a very weakly interacting\nparticle, and that it is irrelevant for BBN.  Neutrino, however, may\naffect abundances of light elements.  The emitted energetic neutrinos\nscatter off background leptons via weak interaction and several\nkinds of particles may be pair-produced.\n\nFirst, charged leptons may be produced via the following\nprocesses:\\footnote\n%%\n{Neutrinos may also scatter off the background electron and positron.\n  However, since the photo-dissociation processes become important\n  when the cosmic temperature becomes much lower than $1\\ {\\rm MeV}$.\n  At such temperature, number densities of electron and positron are\n  exremely suppressed, and hence the scattering processes with\n  electron and positron are irrelevant for the production of charged\n  leptons. }\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\nu_i+\\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&e^{-}+e^{+}\n  \\label{nunu2ee}\\\\\n \\nu_i+\\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\mu^{-}+\\mu^{+}\n  \\\\\n \\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_{e,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\mu^{-}+e^{+}\n  \\\\\n \\nu_e+\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&e^{-}+\\mu^{+}\n  \\label{nunu2emu}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nwhere $i=e,\\mu,\\tau$ is flavor index, and the subscript ``BG'' is for\nbackground particles.  The muons emitted in the above processes quickly\ndecay into electrons and neutrinos.  Thus, the above processes produce\nenergetic electrons and positrons which cause electromagnetic cascade.\nEnergetic photons in the cascade induce photo-dissociation processes\nof light elements.  Effects of these processes have been already\nstudied in~\\cite{Kawasaki:1994bs}.\n\nAnother possible effect is due to the production of pion pairs.\nHigh energy neutrinos scatter off the background neutrinos \nand electrons (positrons) and produce pions as\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\pi^{-}+ \\pi^{+},\n  \\\\\n  \\nu_i + {e}^{\\pm}_{i,{\\rm BG}}&\\to&\\pi^{0}+ \\pi^{\\pm}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nThe nucleus-pion interaction rate is $\\sim 10^8 {\\rm sec}^{-1}\\times\n(T/{\\rm MeV})^3$ which is larger than the decay rate of the charged\npion $(\\sim 4\\times10^7 {\\rm sec}^{-1})$ for $T\\sim 1 {\\rm MeV}$.\nTherefore, the charged pions produced at $T\\sim1 {\\rm MeV}$ scatter\noff the background nuclei and change protons (neutrons) into neutrons\n(protons) via\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\pi^{-}+p&\\to&n+\\pi^{0},~n+\\gamma,\n        \\\\\n        \\pi^{+}+n&\\to&p+\\pi^{0},~p+\\gamma.\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nConsequently, $n/p$ ratio is increased, resulting in more ${}^4{\\rm\n  He}$.  Notice that, because of very short lifetime, the neutral\npions decay before they scatter off the background nuclei and hence\nthey are harmless.\n\nIn order to estimate effects of the high-energy-neutrino induced\nprocesses, we have numerically solved the Boltzmann equation describing\nthe time evolution of the high energy neutrino spectrum taking into\naccount of all the processes above.  Details of our calculation are\ngiven in~\\ref{app:Boltzmann}.\n\n\\subsection{Three and Four-body Decay}\n\nEven though the branching ratio for three and four-body decay\nprocesses are much smaller than 1, such decay processes are very\nimportant since colored and charged particles are directly emitted\nfrom these decay processes.  Energetic colored and charged particles\nmay significantly change the prediction of the standard BBN scenario.\nEffects of these particles are classified into\nthree categories: photo-dissociations, hadro-dissociations and\n$p\\leftrightarrow n$ conversion.\n\nIn order to study the effects of three- and four-body decay processes,\nit is important to obtain the spectra of quarks and leptons emitted by\nthe decay of $X$, which depends on the model.  In our analysis, we\nuse, up to normalization, those obtained in the case where $X$ is the\nsneutrino and $Y$ is the gravitino; in such a case, the sneutrino may\ndecay into the gravitino, neutrino (or charged lepton), and $Z^{(*)}$\n(or $W^{(*)}$), and the produced (real or virtual) weak bosons\nsubsequently decay into quark- or lepton-pair.  (Here, $Z^{*}$ and\n$W^{*}$ denote virtual weak bosons.)  In order to perform our analysis\nas model-independent as possible, we treat that the branching ratio\nfor three- and four-body processes is a free parameter: we define\nbranching ratio $B_X$ as\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  B_X\\equiv\\frac{\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm 3~body})+\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm 4~body})}\n  {\\Gamma(X\\to{\\rm all})},\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\Gamma$ is decay width.  For the study of the effects of\nphoto-dissociation processes and CMB spectral distortion, we also\ncalculate averaged ``visible energy'' emitted from one $X$:\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        E_{\\rm vis}=B_X\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle$ are averaged energy carried away by\ncharged particles and photons in three and four-decay modes.  The\nenergy distributions of photons, neutrinos, leptons and nucleons\nproduced by the decay of $X$ are calculated by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations with the PYTHIA package \\cite{Sjostrand:2000wi}.  In\nFigs.\\ \\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2}-\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e5}, we plot the\nspectra of photons and leptons ($e^+ + e^-$), respectively.  From\nthese distributions we calculate the averaged energy and obtain\n$\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle = 25.3, 146, 821$ and $5630\\ {\\rm GeV}$\nfor $m_X=10^2,10^3,10^4$ and $10^5\\ {\\rm GeV}$, respectively.  Here,\n$m_X$ is the mass of $X$.  $E_{\\rm vis}$ is much smaller than $m_X$\nsince we are interested in the case where $B_X\\ll 1$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m2.ps}\n                \\caption{Spectrum of $e^+ + e^-$ (solid line) and \n                photon (dashed line) with $m_X=10^2{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e2}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m3.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except\n                 $m_X=10^3{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e3}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m4.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except \n                $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e4}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{decay_m5.ps}\n                \\caption{Same as Fig.\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2} except \n                $m_X=10^5{\\rm GeV}$.}\n        \\label{fig:decay_m=1e5}\n        \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nPhoto-dissociation processes are induced by energetic photons in\nelectromagnetic shower which is caused by charged particles and/or\nphotons emitted from $X$.  With given background temperature, the\ndistribution function of energetic photons depends on total amount of\nenergy injected by particles with electromagnetic interaction, and is\ninsensitive to the shape of energy spectrum of primary particles.  Thus,\nonce $E_{\\rm vis}$ is obtained, the energy distribution of energetic\nphotons in the electromagnetic shower can be obtained.  Then,\nphoto-dissociation rates are obtained by convoluting energy distribution\nfunction and cross sections of photo-dissociation reactions.  For\ndetails of our treatment of photo-dissociation processes,\nsee~\\cite{KMrad}.\n\nFor the study of hadro-dissociation processes, it is necessary to\nobtain energy distributions of (primary) hadrons which are produced\nafter the hadronization of quarks emitted from $X$.  We have\ncalculated the spectra of $p$ and $n$ by using PYTHIA.  These hadrons\ncause hadronic shower and induced hadro-dissociation processes.  In\nour analysis, in addition, we have also calculated the number of\ncharged pions produced by the decay of $X$.  Such charged pions,\nprotons and neutrons become the source of $p\\leftrightarrow n$\nconversion process, which changes the number of ${}^4{\\rm\n  He}$~\\cite{Reno:1987qw,Kohri:2001jx}.\\footnote\n%%\n{Here we have neglected the effects of Kaons\nto the $p\\leftrightarrow n$ conversion, according to the\ndiscussion in~\\cite{KKM04}.}\n%%\nOnce the spectra of hadrons are\nobtained, effects of hadro-dissociation  and $p\\leftrightarrow n$\nconversion are studied with the procedure given in \\cite{KKM04}.\n\n\\subsection{Numerical Results}\n\nIn our analysis, we have followed the evolutions of the number densities\nof the light elements.  For this purpose, we have modified the Kawano\ncode \\cite{Kawano:1992ua} including photo- and hadro-dissociation\nprocesses.\n%For details of our calculations, see~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}. \n%As for observational constraints on the light elements, \n%we use the same constraints as~\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm}except \n%${}^3{\\rm He}$.\n%Precise observational determinations of ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ are only possible within our galaxy.\n%The ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ abundance can decrease or increase after the BBN\n%due to galactic and stellar chemical evolution.\n%Therefore, the ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm H}$ in itself can not be solely used for a constraint.\n%Instead we adopt the ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ ratio.\n%D is produced exclusively in the BBN and always destroyed (is burned into ${}^3{\\rm He}$) \n%in stars due to its small binding energy.\n%${}^3{\\rm He}$ may be destroyed or produced.\n%Therefore, ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ monotonically increases with time \n%since ${}^3{\\rm He}$ is much more difficult to destroy than D. \n%When we adopt Protosolar Cloud data~\\cite{2003SSRv..106....3G}, ${}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D}$ is given by\n%%%\n%\\begin{eqnarray}\n%       ({}^3{\\rm He}/{\\rm D})_p < 1.37~~~(2\\sigma).\n%\\end{eqnarray}\n%%%     \nAs observational constraints on the primordial\nabundances of light elements, we adopt those used in\n\\cite{Kanzaki:2006hm} except for $Y_{\\rm p}$ and $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm\nD})_{\\rm p}$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  (n_{\\rm D}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm p} &=& (2.82\\pm 0.26) \\times 10^{-5},\n  \\\\\n   (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.83+0.27,\n%   (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.13}\n%  (n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.59 \\pm 0.27,\n  \\\\\n   Y_{\\rm p} &=& 0.2516 \\pm 0.0040,\n%  Y_{\\rm p} &=& 0.250 \\pm 0.004,\n  \\\\\n  \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm ^7Li}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm p} &=& -9.63 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.3.\n  \\\\\n  (n_{\\rm ^6Li}/n_{\\rm ^7Li})_{\\rm p} &<& 0.046\\pm 0.022 + 0.084,\n  \\label{Li6/Li7}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the subscript ``p'' is for primordial value (just after BBN),\nand $Y_{\\rm p}$ is the primordial mass fraction of ${\\rm ^4He}$. For\nthe center value of $Y_{\\rm p}$, we have adopted the value\nreported in \\cite{Izotov:2007ed} in which the authors used new data of\nHeI emissivities,\\footnote\n%%\n{See also the other recent value of $Y_{\\rm p}$ reported in\n\\cite{Peimbert:2007vm} where the authors adopted larger errors\n(0.0028) than that of \\cite{Izotov:2007ed}.}\n%%\nand conservatively added a larger error (= $0.0040$) as discussed in\n\\cite{Fukugita:2006xy}.  For $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p}$, we\nhave adopted most newly-reported values of D and $^{3}$He abundances\nobserved in protosolar clouds~\\cite{GG03}, $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm\n  H})_{\\rm PSC} = (1.66 \\pm 0.06) \\times 10^{-5}$ and $(n_{\\rm\n  D}/n_{\\rm H})_{\\rm PSC} = (2.00 \\pm 0.35) \\times 10^{-5}$, where the\nsubscript ``PSC'' means a value in the protosolar cloud.  (For the\nimportance of the upper bounds on $(n_{\\rm ^3He}/n_{\\rm D})_{\\rm p}$,\nsee~\\cite{Sigl:1995kk,KKM04}.)\n\nWe parameterize the primordial abundance of $X$ by yield variable $Y_X$\nwhich is defined as the ratio of number density and \ntotal entropy density at ($t \\ll \\tau_X$);\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        Y_X\\equiv\\left[\\frac{n_X}{s}\\right]_{t\\ll \\tau_X},\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\nwhere $\\tau_X$ is the lifetime of $X$.  If $Y_X$ is too large,\nabundances of light elements are too much affected to be consistent\nwith the observations.

Since protons are more abundant than neutrons, a significant\namount of proton may be converted to neutron through nucleus-pion\ninteraction (and nucleon-nuclen interactions for relatively large\n$B_{X}$) and consequently ${}^4{\\rm He}$ is overproduced.  When\n$10^2{\\rm sec}\\lesssim \\tau_X \\lesssim 10^7{\\rm sec}$, the background\n${}^4{\\rm He}$ (which we call $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$) is effectively\ndissociated by the energetic hadrons produced in the hadronic shower.\nIn this case, overproduction of D may occur as a result of\nhadro-dissociation of $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.  In addition, energetic T and\n${}^3{\\rm He}$ are also produced and they synthesize $^6$Li through\nthe ${}^6{\\rm Li}$ via ${\\rm T}+\\alpha_{\\rm BG}\\to {}^6{\\rm Li}+n$ and\n${}^3{\\rm He}+\\alpha_{\\rm BG}\\to {}^6{\\rm Li}+p$.  When\n$\\tau_X\\gtrsim10^7{\\rm sec}$, the energetic hadrons are stopped by the\nscattering processes with background electrons, and hence the effects\nof hadro-dissociation become less efficient than those of the\nphoto-dissociation.  In particular, the energetic photons produced in\nthe electromagnetic shower destroy $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.  In this case,\noverproduction of D and ${}^3{\\rm He}$ occurs as a result of\nphoto-dissociation of $\\alpha_{\\rm BG}$.\n\nThe constraints on $m_X Y_X$ depend on $m_X$ in a non-trivial way.  The\ncontraint coming from the photo-dissociation caused by the two-body\ndecay becomes stringent as $m_X$ increases because neutrinos emitted in\ntwo-body decay have higher energy and scatter off the background\nneutrinos with larger rate. On the other hand, the rates of the\nhadro-dissociation and photo-disocciation caused by the three- and\nfour-body decay depend only on $E_{\\rm vis} Y_X$ and hence the\nconstraints on $m_XY_X$ become slightly milder as $m_X$\nincreses.  The constraint from $n \\leftrightarrow p$ conversion becomes\nweaker as $m_X$ increases. This is because the charged pion production\nis roughly determined by $Y_X$ for the three- and four-decay.\n\n\nSo far, we have shown the results for the case where the primary\nneutrino is electron-type.  However, we have checked that the BBN\nconstraints are almost unchanged even if $X$ decays into muon- or\ntau-neutrino (and $Y$). \n\n\\section{CMB Constraints}\n\\label{sec:cmb}\n\nCMB also imposes constraints on the decays of $X$.\nCOBE observations show that CMB spectrum is almost perfect \nblackbody~\\cite{FIRAS}.\nTherefore any exotic energy injections that cause distortions \nin the spectrum of CMB are stringently \nconstrained~\\cite{Silk:1983hj,Kawasaki:1985ff,Hu:1993gc}.\nWhen the photons are emitted before redshift  $z\\sim 10^7$, \nthey are thermalized by Compton scattering, double Compton \nscattering and bremsstrahlung, and no spectral distortion \ntakes place.\nHowever, at  $z \\lesssim 10^7$ only Compton scattering is efficient.\nSince the Compton scattering does not change the total number of \nphotons, the resultant spectrum becomes a Bose-Einstein \ndistribution with a finite chemical potential $\\mu$, \nregardless of the detail of the injection.\nFor the case of massive particle decay, \nthe number density of injected photons is negligible compared \nwith that in the background.\nTherefore, the spectral distortions are determined by the fraction \nof the energy release, $\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma/\\rho_\\gamma$.  \nThen, for small $\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma/\\rho_\\gamma$ \nthe chemical potential of the photon spectrum is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\mu \n%  \\simeq \n%  \\frac{1}{2.143}\\left[3\\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}\n%\t\t  -4\\frac{\\Delta n_\\gamma}{n_\\gamma}\\right]\n \\simeq\\frac{1}{0.714}\\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}.\n        \\label{mu_energy_relation}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \n%%\n%where $\\Delta n_{\\gamma}/n_{\\gamma}$ is the fraction of the \n%injected photon number.\n\nAs we have discussed, there are two types of processes which contribute\nto the electromagnetic energy injection ($\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma$) in the\npresent scenario.  One is the two-body decay process: the high energy\nprimary neutrinos emitted by $X$ scatter off the background neutrinos\nand create charged leptons whose energy is finally converted to the\nenergy of radiation.  The other is the three- and four-body decay\nprocesses by which quarks and charged leptons are produced.  In our\nanalysis, we have taken into account both of these contributions.\n\n%There are two processes which contribute to the electromagnetic \n%energy injection ($\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma$) in the present scenario.\n%One is the contribution from two-body decay of $X$.\n%The massive long-lived particle $X$ is presumed to decay mainly to an \n%invisible particle ($Y$) and a neutrino.\n%The high energy neutrinos emitted in the decay scatter off \n%background neutrinos and create lepton pairs \n%whose  energy is finally converted to the photon energy.\n%The other is from three and four-body decay of $X$.\n%In our case, three and four-body decays of $X$ are $X\\to Y+\\nu+Z(Z^*)$ and \n%$X\\to Y+l+W(W^*)$ where $l$ is charged lepton.\n%These $Z(Z^*)$ and $W(W^*)$ decay to various particles and \n%contribute to the electro-magnetic energy.\n\n\\subsection{Three and four-body Decay}\n\nThere are two quantities which are required to calculate \nthe electromagnetic energy injection:\nbranching ratio $B_X$ and the averaged energy $\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle$.\n\nWe follow the treatment of~\\cite{Hu:1993gc} for the case of \nthree and four-body decays.\nUsing the fact that $X$\ndecays exponentially in time with lifetime \n$\\tau_X$, we obtain\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\frac{\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_\\gamma}\n  =\\frac{\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle}{2.701T(t_{\\rm eff})}\n  \\frac{n_X}{n_\\gamma}B_X ,\n  \\label{energy_ratio}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $T(t)$ is the CMB temperature  and \n$n_X$ is the number density of $X$ before decay.\nHere $t_{\\rm eff} = \\left[\\Gamma(1+\\beta)\\right]^{1/\\beta}\\tau_X$\nfor time-temperature relation $T\\propto t^{-\\beta}$,\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the gamma function. \n\nFrom Eqs.~(\\ref{mu_energy_relation}) and (\\ref{energy_ratio}), \nwe find that the chemical potential is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\mu\\simeq4.00\\times10^2\n        \\left(\\frac{\\tau_X}{1{\\rm sec}}\\right)^{1/2}\n        \\left(\\frac{\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle}{1{\\rm GeV}}\\right)\n        B_X\\frac{n_X}{n_\\gamma}.\n        \\label{mu_decay}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nWe have assumed here that we are in the radiation dominated \nepoch where $T\\propto t^{-1/2}$.\nNote that, however, photon number changing processes \n(double Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung) become \nincreasingly efficient as the photon frequency decreases.\nThis means the spectrum becomes blackbody at low frequencies.\nThe photons with low frequencies produced by the photon-number\nchanging processes are transferred to higher frequencies \nby inverse Compton scattering and the chemical potential \ndecreases in time.  \nFor a low $\\Omega_b h^2$ universe suggested by the\nBBN~\\cite{Steigman:2005uz} and WMAP~\\cite{Spergel:2006hy}\n(where, in this paper, $\\Omega_b$ denotes the density parameter\nof baryon, and $h$ is the Hubble constant in units of\n$100\\ {\\rm km/sec/Mpc}$), double\nCompton scattering dominates the thermalization process.  The chemical\npotential produced at $t=t_h$ is blurred out at an exponential rate and\nthe present value is given by~\\cite{Danese;1982}\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\mu_0\\equiv\\mu(t_0)=\\mu(t_h)\\exp(-(t_{\\rm DC}/t_h)^{5/4})\n        \\label{mu_evolution}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%       \nwith\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        t_{\\rm DC}=6.81\\times10^6\n        \\left(\\frac{\\Omega_b h^2}{0.0223}\\right)^{4/5}\n        \\left(1-\\frac{Y_p}{2}\\right)^{4/5} {\\rm sec}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nCombining Eq.~(\\ref{mu_decay})\nwith Eq.~(\\ref{mu_evolution}), we find that the chemical potential today\nis given by~\\cite{Hu:1993gc}\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\mu_0\\simeq4.00\\times10^2\n        \\left(\\frac{\\tau_X}{1{\\rm sec}}\\right)^{1/2}\n        \\exp(-(t_{\\rm DC}/\\tau_X)^{5/4})\n        \\left(\\frac{\\langle E_{\\rm vis}\\rangle}{1{\\rm GeV}}\\right)\n        B_X\\frac{n_X}{n_\\gamma}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\n\nFor late energy injection $(z \\lesssim 10^5 )$, Compton scattering can\nno longer establish the Bose-Einstein distribution.  In this case, the\nspectrum can be described by the Compton $y$-parameter which is defined\nby\n%%\n\\begin{equation}\n    y = \\int dt \\frac{T_e -T}{m_e}n_e\\sigma_T,\n\\end{equation}\n%%\nwhere $m_e$ and $T_e$ are the number density and temperature of \nelectrons and $\\sigma_T$ is Thomson cross section. \nThen the energy injection is related to $y$ as\n$\\Delta\\rho_\\gamma/\\rho_\\gamma=4y$.\nHere, we define $z_K$ as the redshift at which \nthe time scale for energy exchange through Compton scatterings \nis equal to the Hubble

\nevolution of $r$.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ratio1} shows that the ratio $r$ increases \nwith $m_X$.\nThis is because higher energy neutrino has larger cross section\nfor scattering off the background neutrino \nand is also easy to exceed the \nthreshold energy for lepton pair creations.\nThe similar logic applies to Fig.~\\ref{fig:ratio2}.\nIn this case, background neutrino energy increases with

However, the\nemitted ultra-relativistic particles (neutrino and $Y$) contribute to\nthe total relativistic energy and could lead to a more stringent\nconstraint than that from spectral distortion, when branching ratio is\nsufficiently small.  Before recombination, the CMB angular power\nspectrum is sensitive to the change of the total relativistic energy\nthrough the early integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect~\\cite{Zentner:2001zr}.\nIn addition, too much relativistic energy affects the growth of large\nscale structure (LSS) since the epoch for the matter-radiation equality\nbecomes later.

Here neutrinos produced\nwith energy $E$ are redshifted to the observed energy $E_0=E/(1+z)$ and\n$E$ is just half of the mass of $X$.  The source spectrum\n$dN_\\nu/dE_0$ is given by\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\frac{dN_\\nu(E_0)}{dE_0} =f_i\\delta(E-E_0(1+z)),\n  \\label{neutrino_source}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $f_i$ is the fraction of the neutrino spacies $i=e, \\mu,\n\\tau$ emitted by the decay of $X$.  (Notice that $\\sum_{i} f_i=1$.)  We\nhave assumed that only electron neutrinos are produced in the decay\nprocess.  However, we should take the effects of neutrino oscillations\ninto account.  Neutrino oscillations can be described by six parameters:\ntwo independent mass differences $( \\Delta m^2_{12},\\Delta m^2_{23})$,\nthree mixing angles $(\\theta_{12},\\theta_{23},\\theta_{13})$ and a\nCP-violating phase $\\delta$.

The\n%value of $\\theta_{\\rm atom}$ that fits the data best is $45^\\circ$.  \nA mixing angle $\\theta_{12}$ is determined by solar neutrino experiments\nas $\\theta_{12} \\simeq 34^{\\circ}$~\\cite{Aharmim:2005gt}.  CHOOZ\nexperiment presented a mixing angle $\\theta_{13} <\n12^\\circ$~\\cite{Apollonio:2002gd}.

The\natmospheric neutrino has been observed by\nSuper-Kamiokande~\\cite{Ashie:2005ik} and AMANDA~\\cite{Geenen:2003gg}.\nFor observational flux of energy range $0.3-1.0\\times10^3~{\\rm GeV}$ we\nadopt the result in~\\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2006ay} where the atmospheric\nneutrino fluxes are estimated from the data on atmospheric neutrino\nevent rates measured by the Super-Kamiokande experiment.  For higher\nernergy range $1.3\\times10^3-3.0\\times10^5~{\\rm GeV}$ we use the\natmospheric neutrino spectrum derived from AMANDA. In\nFig.~\\ref{fig:neutrino_flux}, we show the atmospheric neutrino fluxes\nfrom the Super-Kamiokande and AMANDA experiments as well as the diffuse\nneutrino fluxes from the $X$ decay.\n\nFuthermore, the diffuse neutrino flux is also constrained from null\ndetection of the relic supernova $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux by\nSuper-Kamiokande. In~\\cite{Malek:2002ns}, the upperbound on\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux is obtained as $\\Phi_{\\bar{\\nu}_e}\\le\n1.2\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ above threshold of $ E_\\nu >\n19.3\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nWe require that the neutrino flux from $X$ decay should not exceed the\nobserved atmospheric $\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ flux and upperlimit of the\nrelic supernona $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux, which leads to the constraints on\nthe abundance of $X$ as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dif_neu}.  In the figure\nwe also show the constraint from relic supernova search only.  When\nlifetime is short, the constraint is very weak since the neutrinos get\nredshifted until the present and their energy becomes lower than the\n$20$~MeV. For intermediate lifetime, the constraints on the abundances\nof $X$ are determined by the relic supernova $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ search and\nthey are in proportion to $m_X$ because the diffuse $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux\nis determined by the number of injected neutrinos above threshold\nenergy, hence $Y_X$.  When lifetime is long, however, the constraints\nare determined by atmospheric neutrino fluxes.  Since the neutrino flux\nhas a peak at $\\sim m_X /(1+z_{d})$ ($z_d$: redshift at $t=\\tau_X$), the\nmaximum differential neutrino flux is propotional to $Y_X/m_X$. On the\nother hand, the observed differential neutrino flux is roughly\npropotional to $E^{-3}$ and hence $m_X^{-3}$ at $E\\sim m_X$. Therefore,\nthe constraint on $m_X Y_X$ depends on $m_X$ as $m_X m_X^{-3}/m_X^{-1}\n\\sim m_X^{-1}$.\nThis means the constraints become severe with larger mass as shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:dif_neu}.  Constraints for lifetimes longer than present\ntime $t_0$ scale by a factor $t_0/\\tau_X$ relative to the constraints at\n$t_0=\\tau_X$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{neutrino_flux.ps}\n  \\vspace{-1cm}\n                \n  \\caption{Atmospheric neutrino flux.

In calculating the diffuse\nphoton spectrum, we must consider primary photon spectrum which is not\nmonoenergetic.  In addition, we should also take account of the\nabsorption of gamma rays along the line of sight.  \n\nSince photons are produced through three- and four-body decays, their\nspectrum is not monochromatic unlike neutrino.  The energy distributions\nof photons, neutrinos, leptons and nucleons produced by the three- and\nfour-body decay of $X$ are shown in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e2}-\\ref{fig:decay_m=1e5}.  The energy of\nproduced electrons and positrons is transferred to the background\nphotons through inverse Compton process.\n%Therefore the observed photon\n%flux is the sum of that produced directly by $X$-particle decay and\n%inverse Compton process.  \nIn calculating the photon flux, we have taken into account the photons\nproduced by the inverse Compton process as well as those from the\ncascade decay chain induced by the three- and four-body decay of $X$.\nThe latter effect becomes more important for high energy photons.\nHowever, since the inverse Compton process produces many soft photons,\nthe formar process becomes more significant for low energy photons.  The\ndetails of calculation of inverse Compton process are given\nin~\\ref{app:inv}.  Nucleons are also produce in the decay and they\nproduce photons through inverse Compton process or $\\beta$\ndecay. However, we neglect this effect since the number density of\nproduced nucleons is sufficiently small.  In Fig.~\\ref{fig:phot_spec},\nwe plot photon flux for $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{phot_spec.ps} \\caption{Photon\n   spectrum versus photon energy for $m_X=10^4{\\rm GeV}$.

At the eraly epochs absorption and scattering due to the\nbackground photons are important, whereas significant absorption by\ndiffuse IR-UV photons emitted from galaxies takes place at\nlater epochs.\n\nFirst let us consider the radiative processes due to the background\nphotons.  In the present case, the relevant processes are photon-photon\nscattering and photon pair creation~\\cite{1989ApJ...344..551Z}.  Then,\nphotons degrade their energy by producing electron-positron pairs or\ndividing their energy with the background photons.  The photon spectrum\nwas calculated in detail in~\\cite{Kribs:1996ac}. According\nto~\\cite{Kribs:1996ac} the present differential flux of photons is given\nby\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\frac{d\\Phi_\\gamma}{dE_0} &= &\n        \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int^{z_*}_0 dz\\frac{1}{H_0h(z)}\n        \\frac{Y_Xs_0}{\\tau_X}\\exp(-t/\\tau_X) \\nonumber \\\\\n         & & \\times \\int dE \\mathcal{L}_s(E_0(1+z),E,z)\n         \\mathcal{L}_i(E,z)B_X,\n         \\label{eq:photon_flux}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%      \nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_i(E,z)$ is the number of photons per unit energy\nproduced both directly and by inverse Compton at $z$ for one $X$ decay,\nand $z_*( \\simeq 700)$ is the redshift at which the optical depth of\nhigh enrergy photons becomes $1$.  In addition,\n$\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ is the number of photons per unit energy in\nthe spectrum when photons with energy $E_1$ are produced by scattering\nof photons with energy $E_2$ at redshift $z$.  If there is no\nscattering, $\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ becomes $\\delta(E_1-E_2)$. (The\nconcrete expression of $\\mathcal{L}_s(E_1,E_2,z)$ is found in\n\\cite{Kribs:1996ac}.)\n\nIn addition, $\\gamma$ rays with GeV to TeV energies are absorbed via\nelectron-positron pair production on diffuse background IR-UV photons\nwhich have been emitted by\ngalaxies~\\cite{Salamon:1997ac,Primack:2000xp,Stecker:2005qs}.  In this\npaper, we adopt the result of \\cite{Stecker:2005qs} which calculated the\noptical depth $\\tau_{\\rm IR}$ of the universe for $\\gamma$ rays having\nenergies from 4 GeV to 100 TeV at redshifts from 0 to 5.  (See Fig.~8 in\n\\cite{Stecker:2005qs}.)  Then the resultant photon spectrum is given by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:photon_flux}) multiplied by $e^{-\\tau_{\\rm IR}}$.  We\nneglect the secondary soft photons produced via\nelectron-positron pair production on diffuse background IR-UV photons,\nand only consider the attenuation of high energy photons. \n\n\n%These soft photons should make the constraint severer.  \n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:photon_flux}, we show the diffuse photon flux from the\nCOMPTEL \\cite{1996A&AS..120C.619K} and EGRET \\cite{1998ApJ...494..523S}\nobservations and decay of $X$, from which we obtain the upper limit on\nthe abundance of $X$ as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dif_phot}.  Compared with\nthe limit from the neutrino flux, the constraints from photon flux are\nalmost insensitive to $m_X$. This can be understood as follows.  The\ndifferential photon flux at the peak energy is roughly proportional to\n$Y_X/m_X$ from the same reasoning as the neutrino flux in\nSec.~\\ref{subsec:neutrino_flux}, while the observed one is proportional\nto $E^{-2} \\propto m_X^{-2}$. Thus, the constraint on $Y_X$ depends on $m_X$\nas $m_X^{-2}m_X \\sim m_X^{-1}$, which means that the limit on $m_X Y_X$\nis almost insensitive to $m_X$. \nFig.~\\ref{fig:dif_phot} shows that the constraints become less stringent\nwith larger $m_X$ when lifetime is long.  There are two reasons for this.\nOne is EGRET had observed up to $100{\\rm GeV}$.  When $m_X$ is large,\nthe present photon energy at which the flux becomes maximum  may exceed\nthe energy range of EGRET observation.  The other is higher energy photons are\nmore effectively absorbed by diffuse background photons.  \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\begin{figure}[thbp]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{photon_flux.ps}\n  \\caption{Diffuse photon flux.

In this paper, a source of high energy photon is charged\nleptons and pions which are produced through scattering of high energy\nneutrinos off background leptons.  Therefore, we determine the time\nevolution of the distribution function of high energy neutrinos in order\nto investigate the photon spectrum.  In this appendix, we write down\nBoltzmann equations which determines the high energy neutrino spectrum.\nOur notation is the same as~\\cite{Moroi:1995fs}.\n\nThe high energy neutrinos ($\\nu$) produced in $X$ decay scatter off\nthe thermal neutrino ($\\nu_b$) in the background by the following processes;\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    \\nu_{i} + \\nu_{i,b} &\\rightarrow & \\nu_i + \\nu_i , \n     \\label{reaction:neu-neu1} \\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_i,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_j + \\bar{\\nu}_j ,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\nu_{j,b} &\\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\nu_j,\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{j,b} & \\rightarrow &\\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_j, \n     \\label{reaction:neu-neu2} \\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} &\\rightarrow & e^{-}  + e^{+},\\\\\n    \\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} & \\rightarrow & \\mu^{-}  + \\mu^{+}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere index $i$ and $j$ represent $e$, $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ with $i\\neq j$.\nAll the amplitude squared $|{\\cal M}|^2$ in these reactions take the\nfollowing form:\n%%\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    |{\\cal M}|^2 = 32G_F^2[ \n    a(pp')^2 + b(pq)^2 + c(pq')^2 + d m^2 (pp')] ,\n    \\label{amplitude}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n%%\nwhere $G_F \\simeq 1.17\\times 10^{-5}{\\rm GeV}^{-2}$ is the Fermi constant,\nthe coefficients $a$ -- $d$ depend on the individual reaction, $p$ and\n$p'$ are the initial momenta of high energy neutrino and background\nneutrino, $q$ and $q'$ are the final momenta, and $m$ represents the\nmass of the fermion the in final state. \nCoefficients for each processes are given in Table~\\ref{table:neutrino-neutrino}. \n%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%TABLE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%\n\\begin{table}\n%\n\\begin{center}\n%\n\\begin{tabular}{c|lccc} \\hline \\hline\n%\n{Process} &\n{~~a~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~b~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~c~~~~~~~~~} &\n{~~~~~~~~~d~~~~~~~~~} \\\\ \\hline\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\nu_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\nu_i$} &\n{~~2} &  {0} & {0} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_i$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {9} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_j + \\bar{\\nu}_j$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {1} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\nu_{j,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\nu_j$} &\n{~~1} &  {0} & {0} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{j,b} \\rightarrow \\nu_i + \\bar{\\nu}_j$} &\n{~~0} &  {0} & {1} &  {0} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow l_i^{-}  + l_i^{+}$} &\n{~~0} & {$(C_V-C_A)^2$} & {$(C_V+C_A+2)^2$} & {$(C_V-C_A)(C_V+C_A+2)$} \\\\\n%\n{$\\nu_{i} + \\bar{\\nu}_{i,b} \\rightarrow l_j^{-}  + l_j^{+}$} &\n{~~0} & {$(C_V-C_A)^2$} & {$(C_V+C_A)^2$} & {$C^2_V-C^2_A$} \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n%\n\\end{tabular}\n%\n\\caption{Coefficients $a$ -- $d$ for each processes.

In the\nThomson limit corresponding to $\\Gamma\\ll1$, the first two terms of the\nright hand side of Eq.~(\\ref{collision_number}) is dominant.  In this\ncase, many low-energy photons are produced.  In the extreme\nKlein-Nishina limit corresponding to $\\Gamma\\gg1$, the last term of the\nright hand side of Eq.~(\\ref{collision_number}) is dominant at larger\n$q$ and photon spectra have peaks near the high-energy\nend~\\cite{Blumenthal:1970gc}.
